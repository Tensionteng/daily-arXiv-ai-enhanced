Instead of treating\nthe GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual\nelements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality\nindependently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions\nare ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by\ngenerating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions\nand incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result.

These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent\ndocumentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for\naccurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table\nextraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor\nperformance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This\npaper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be\nextracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,\ncausing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a\nnovel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically\nenriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text\nlinearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve\nboth structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental\nevaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates\nTalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering\ntasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS\nTextract Visual Q&A capabilities.

Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely\non semantic similarity, \\textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the\nplanning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.\nOur experiments demonstrate that \\textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of\nthe observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent\nperformance within the context limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLineRetriever\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u5bfc\u822a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u884c\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLineRetriever\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u89c2\u5bdf\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LineRetriever\u4e3a\u7f51\u9875\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations.

But as math leaderboards improve week by week,\nit is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or\njust narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20\nopen-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including\nmath, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard\ninstruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in\nmath fail to transfer their gains to other domains.

However, multi-hop\nquestions, such as \"Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the\nbiggest profit in 2023?,\" challenge RAG because relevant facts are often\ndistributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,\nmaking it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To\naddress this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question\ndecomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,\n(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged\ncandidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the\nretrieved evidence.

Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID\nbased on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)\nguiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)\niteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in\nboth code execution and mobile device control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u56fe\uff08CIDs\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u4ee3\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u610f\u5916\u540e\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u8303\u521d\u59cb\u5316CID\uff0c(2) \u4f7f\u7528CID\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c(3) \u6839\u636e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316CID\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CIP\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u56fe\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Arguably, effective safety\nevaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover\na broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose\npotential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on\nhandcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the\nintensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with\nrapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation\noffers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods\noften suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level\ndiversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem\nfrom the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack\nof real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both\ntopically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose\nReality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses\nmulti-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for\ngenerating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.\nExperiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety\nvulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in\nintegrated evaluation metrics.

Our evaluation focuses on two\ncore questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad\nintegration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,\nminimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our\nad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing\nstrategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection\nperformance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,\nthrough both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad\nstealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an\nadversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware\ngenerative search systems and robust ad classifiers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5e7f\u544a\u7ba1\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e7f\u544a\u91cd\u5199\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5e7f\u544a\u63d2\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7f\u544a\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e7f\u544a\u91cd\u5199\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u5019\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u4f18\u5316\u5e7f\u544a\u63d2\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7f\u544a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5e7f\u544a\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5171\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

The method represents semantic\nfeatures in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a\ndynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule\nlayers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures\nbetween semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional\nfeature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial\nsemantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through\nan iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based\nmechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's\nability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using\na public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are\nused for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms\ntraditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,\nF1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the\nnumber of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve\nof the loss function during training is provided.

In this work, we leverage a\nlarge-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital\nContact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast\nmobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial\nsparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits\nthe predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we\npropose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN)\ntechnique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its\nimmediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting\nbackbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input\nlengths.

To support Phase II\nof the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power\nprofiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both\nuniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions.

However, accurately\nforecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due\nto the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of\niceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg\nmotion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a\nhighly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These\nlimitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture\nthe underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep\nlearning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift\nphysics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the\npattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth\nobservations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network\nthat captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future\niceberg drift positions. We compare IDRIFTNET model performance with\nstate-of-the-art models on two Antarctic icebergs: A23A and B22A. Our findings\ndemonstrate that IDRIFTNET outperforms other models by achieving a lower Final\nDisplacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across a variety\nof time points.

As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to\nunderstand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to\nindividual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a\nutilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits\nfor the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals.

While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked\nLanguage Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models\npretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as\nencoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation\nbenchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent\nadvantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model\nand data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of\nlarge-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30\nmodels ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over\n15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM\ngenerally yields better performance across text representation tasks,\nCLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning\nstability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic\ntraining strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal\nperformance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from\nreadily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),\nreducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.\nWe release all project artifacts at https://hf.co/MLMvsCLM to foster further\nresearch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86CLM\u548cMLM\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CLM\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76CLM\u548cMLM\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0830\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c15,000\u6b21\u5fae\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83CLM\u548cMLM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "CLM\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800cMLM\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408CLM\u548cMLM\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u5408\u4ece\u73b0\u6709CLM\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002"}}

This is\nespecially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by\nperiodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains\nvaluable.

This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model\nupdate algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these\nlimitations.

This contrast is\nprimarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition\ntime, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast\nidentification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly\nused, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition\nsettings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,\nleaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding\nto this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or\ninconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks\nsuch as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical\nworkflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to\nenable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving\nmodality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework\nthat aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware\nrepresentations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse\nclinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures\ncontrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling\nanatomy-invariant representations.

Empirical\nevaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy\nconsumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the\nhybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and\nreduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy\nAppliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and\nInceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps\ninto domain-specific narratives (e.g., \"Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds\nsuggests myocardial ischemia\"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L\n(0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and\nspatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical\noutputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for\ntransparent, time-aware decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408ResNet\u548cTransformer\u70ed\u56fe\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0cTransformer\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u878d\u5408ResNet\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u6fc0\u6d3b\u56fe\u548cTransformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165NLP\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728PhysioNet\u548cUCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523094.1%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cRMSE=0.28 kWh\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u4fdd\u771f\uff0c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This\nreliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and\nlimited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches\nlack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design\ncontributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To\naddress these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed\nhuman failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven\nby AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the\ninterface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated\ngraph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables\nautomated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated\noperational paths.

The lifted dynamics\nobtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making\nmodel learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted\nquadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms\nanalytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained\noptimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a\nstructure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields\ncomputationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the\nunderlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the\ngeneralizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed\nstructure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the\none-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the\ntwo-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional\nKlein-Gordon-Zakharov equations.

Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral\nand political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based\nsocial decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected\nwhen the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a\npressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect\nreciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.\nHere, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide\n21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate\n-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these\ninteractions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary\ngame-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where\nthe extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of\nLLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating\ncooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and\nbetween-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals.\nWe show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact\nthe prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms,\nshowing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through\ngoal-oriented prompts.

The purpose of \\emph{partial label learning}\n(PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels\nassociated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of\ndiffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their\npotential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.\nTherefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the\nperspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively\nrefining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model\nto learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the\ngeneration uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label\nfor classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch\nbetween instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a \\emph{diffusion disambiguation model\nfor PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information\nbetween instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial\ndiffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to\nestimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated\nduring the diffusion generation.

In this work, we focus\non analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We\nshow that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a\nmodel to recall a value associated with a single key without context,\ninsufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling.\nTo address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel\nsynthetic task, \\emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value\nassociated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove\nthat SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in\nsub-quadratic time complexity.

Equal contribution by Kiyoung Om,\n  Kyuil Sim, and Taeyoung Yun", "summary": "Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints\nis a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.\nThese problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to\nhard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have\nbeen developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of\ndimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a\npromising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from\npoor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the\ntarget distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new\nframework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.\nFirst, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and\nsurrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations\nwith uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection\nproblem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising\ncandidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.\nDuring posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly\nmulti-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when\nconstraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate\nthis issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the\nlatent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data\nspace. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance\non various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks.\nOur code is publicly available \\href{https://github.com/umkiyoung/CiBO}{here}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\uff1b2) \u5c06\u5019\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5e73\u6ed1\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their\nown bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating\nperformance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general\nsystems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic\nBenchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and\nverifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three\nunique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications\nand corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the\nbenchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions.\nWhile the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that\nmany frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii)\ntranslation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after\neach of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different\nsubsteps of the overall problem.

However, PbRL can\nsuffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward\nmodel. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and\nfine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,\nusing different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose\nchallenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to\neffectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM\nassumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two\nparts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term\navailable before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward\nfunction, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce\nstate-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks\nin the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method\nachieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior\nrewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a\nnegated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka\nPanda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot.

Question difficulty is\noften represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression\ndue to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature\nhas neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or\ndiscretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods\nremaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to\nthe modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics\nfail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately\naddress class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This\nstudy addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs\n-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the\nbalanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly\ncaptures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal\nregression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit\nmodel from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and\nARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on\ncomplex tasks.

As AI\nsystems increasingly mediate decision-making in domains such as auditing and\nfinancial reporting, traditional mechanisms of accountability, based on\ncontrol, transparency, and auditability, are being destabilised. We integrate\nthe Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and\ninstitutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in\nresponse to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national\nboundaries.

However, the high resolution\nand large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying\nDeep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller\npatches with a global label (\\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a\n(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution\nfor WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high\nvariability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15\nAUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL\nmethods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight\ninitialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To\naddress that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL\nmethods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most\nstable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be\napplied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability.

This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically\ndesigned for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with\ndifferent parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the\nrepresentational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the\nfirst 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset\nfeaturing global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single\nyear, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling\nstrategies.

Large\nknowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to\ndistill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream\napplications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations:\nthey are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive\nlearning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory\nlimits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation\nALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality\nembeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce\nglobal embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of\nentities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message\npassing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream\nmachine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms\nprevious methods on downstream tasks.

This\nformulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference\nmechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs,\nmasks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce\ngeologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot\ngeneralization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining\nfor new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage\ntraining process that combines self-supervised representation learning on\nlarge-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts\nand labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad\napplicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy\nanalysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic\nstratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By\nbridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware\nmanner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical\nAI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated,\npromptable reasoning system.

However, existing\nSequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads\nacross devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication\noverhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)\nsequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to\novercome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for\nlong sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length\nacross 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an\n16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new\ncollective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with\nprecisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal\ncommunication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.\nTheoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only\nnegligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication\ncosts of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that\nAll-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on\n256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\\% speedup compared to\nthe current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method.

This task-aware signal\nadaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more\naggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in\ninformative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection\nbenchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster\nR-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms\nprominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over\n54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model\nperformance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing\ndata efficiency for large-scale model training.

Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene\ndescriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs\ncan respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a\nbox-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs\non spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express\nintent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for\nfocused queries in complex scenes.

To\nsupport this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual\nattributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object\ntrajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs.

We propose a computationally efficient\nmachine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to\nperform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for\nreal-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised\nroom-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the\noverlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the\nimages of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally,\nthe pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified\nin the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's\nimages using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model.

However, 4D mitral valve (MV)\nanalysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion\nartifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency\nin existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a\nMotion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV\nultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL).

Similar to the era of traditional DNNs,\nmodel stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized\nmodels. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods\n(developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from\nscratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment,\nor are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for\npersonalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our\nmethod consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow\nmodels that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting\ndataset-specific features.

However, the\nincreasing sophistication of sampling algorithms is correlated with an increase\nin the tuning burden. There is now a greater need than ever to treat the tuning\nof samplers as a learning task in its own right. In a conceptual breakthrough,\nWang et al (2025) formulated Metropolis-Hastings as a Markov decision process,\nopening up the possibility for adaptive tuning using Reinforcement Learning\n(RL). Their emphasis was on theoretical foundations; realising the practical\nbenefit of Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) was left for\nsubsequent work. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we observe the\nsurprising result that natural choices of reward, such as the acceptance rate,\nor the expected squared jump distance, provide insufficient signal for training\nRLMH.

In Phase 2, a randomized controlled\ntrial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance.\n[Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in\nsubsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither\ndifference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was\nstatistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1.

In this work, we apply four\ngenerative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of\nforced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from\ncoarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a\npre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and\nDiffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process\nscore. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and\nclassifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and\nobservation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and\nanisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two\nobservation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy\nobservations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the\nreconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and\nquantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors.\nWe also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength.\nResults show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates\nreasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed\nfine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they\nreconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with\nobservations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra.\nFurther, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable\nfrom their ensemble standard deviations.

However, for high-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems, the regression\nproblem becomes simultaneously computationally intractable and ill-conditioned.\nAlthough, in principle, modeling only the dynamics evolving on the underlying\nslow manifold addresses both of these challenges, the truncated fast variables\nhave to be compensated by including higher-order nonlinearities as candidate\nterms for the model, leading to an explosive growth in the size of the SINDy\nlibrary. In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and\nefficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow\nmanifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of\nthe slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables\nrestricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is\nleveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains\nonly essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than\ncontaining all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom\nlibrary is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific\nproblem at hand.

With powerful semantic\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent\nagents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this\narticle, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are\nsemi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used\nfor system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of\nurban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we\nsurvey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,\nencompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and\nlearning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into\nfive groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and\nurban society, presenting representative works in each group.

However, prior research has\ndemonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the\ntraining set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding\nself-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for\nsingle-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid\nMamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance\nhave been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel\nhybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech\nenhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended\n(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging\nnoise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our\nproposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar\ncomplexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020\nand EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset\nVB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the\ntime- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization\nperformance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a\nnotable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets.
