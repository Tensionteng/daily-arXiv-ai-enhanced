### [1] [STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent for Biomedical Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02004)
*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELLA是一种自进化的AI代理，通过动态工具库和模板库自主提升能力，在生物医学任务中表现优异且性能随经验提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学研究中数据碎片化和静态AI工具无法适应快速变化的问题。

Method: 采用多代理架构，包括动态工具库（Tool Ocean）和模板库（Template Library），通过工具创建代理自动发现和集成新工具。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中表现优异，如Humanity's Last Exam（26%）、LAB-Bench: DBQA（54%）和LAB-Bench: LitQA（63%），性能随经验提升。

Conclusion: STELLA代表了AI代理系统的重大进步，能够动态扩展专业知识，加速生物医学发现。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

### [2] [HCVR: A Hybrid Approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02073)
*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCVR是一种轻量级基于规则的特征选择方法，结合P2P和P2T相关性，通过多数投票规则消除冗余特征并保留相关特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法在性能和效率上存在不足，HCVR旨在通过混合非迭代和迭代过滤方法提升特征选择效果。

Method: HCVR采用贪心算法，通过后向消除和多数投票规则，结合相关性阈值进行特征选择。

Result: 在SPAMBASE数据集上，HCVR表现优于传统非迭代和迭代方法，提升了分类器性能。

Conclusion: HCVR是一种有效的特征选择方法，适用于轻量级和高性能需求场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了提升大型语言模型（LLM）推理计算效率的策略，提出了两级分类法（L1可控性和L2适应性），并讨论了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在推理时计算效率低下，无法根据任务复杂度动态调整计算资源，导致简单问题过度计算或复杂问题计算不足。

Method: 提出了两级分类法：L1（固定计算预算下的方法）和L2（基于输入难度或模型置信度动态调整计算的方法），并对主流LLM进行了基准测试。

Result: 研究表明，TTC方法在推理性能和计算资源使用之间存在权衡，强调了方法的实际可控性、适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括混合思维模型等，目标是使LLM在计算效率、鲁棒性和用户约束响应方面更优。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciGym是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在开放式科学发现任务中实验设计和分析能力的基准测试，通过干实验室模拟生物系统，克服湿实验室的高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的科学能力，特别是实验设计和结果解释能力，这些在现有研究中未被充分测试。

Method: 使用系统生物学标记语言（SBML）编码的生物系统模型生成模拟数据，评估六种前沿LLM在137个小系统和350个总系统上的表现。

Result: 性能更强的模型表现更优，但所有模型在系统复杂性增加时表现显著下降。

Conclusion: LLM在科学能力方面仍有显著提升空间，SciGym为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

### [5] [What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103)
*Daniel Durstewitz,Bruno Averbeck,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了现代AI模型如何从神经科学中学习，以实现持续适应环境的能力，并提出了NeuroAI领域的双向学习议程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型训练成本高且固定，而动物能持续适应环境变化，尤其是社交物种。论文旨在探索AI如何借鉴神经科学实现类似能力。

Method: 整合AI中的持续学习和上下文学习文献，以及神经科学中关于行为任务学习的研究，提出双向学习框架。

Result: 提出了NeuroAI领域的议程，强调AI可以从神经科学中学习持续适应能力，同时神经科学也能从AI中获益。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁AI与神经科学的双向学习，推动NeuroAI领域发展，以实现更灵活的AI系统。

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

### [6] [The Illusion of Fairness: Auditing Fairness Interventions with Audit Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02152)
*Disa Sariola,Patrick Button,Aron Culotta,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用审计研究数据改进自动招聘算法的训练和评估，发现传统公平干预方法存在隐性偏差，并提出基于个体处理效应估计的新干预方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决AI系统（如招聘算法）中的偏见问题，传统方法因数据选择偏差和标签偏差而效果有限，审计研究数据提供了更高质量的数据支持。

Method: 方法包括利用审计研究数据（如虚构简历）进行随机对照试验，评估传统公平干预方法的隐性偏差，并引入基于个体处理效应估计的新干预方法。

Result: 结果显示，传统方法在表面上实现公平，但实际存在约10%的隐性偏差；新干预方法进一步减少了算法歧视。

Conclusion: 结论指出审计研究数据能显著改进算法的公平性评估和训练，新方法在减少歧视方面更具优势。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

### [7] [Data Diversification Methods In Alignment Enhance Math Performance In LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02173)
*Berkan Dokmeci,Qingyang Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Ce Zhang,Shuaiwen Leon Song,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过数据多样化策略提升大语言模型的数学推理能力，提出了一种名为Diversified-Think-Solve（DTS）的新方法，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管偏好学习在人类反馈对齐方面取得了进展，但数学推理仍是一个挑战。研究旨在通过数据多样化策略提升模型的数学推理能力。

Method: 评估了三种数据生成方法（温度采样、思维链提示和蒙特卡洛树搜索），并提出了DTS方法，通过系统分解问题为多样化推理路径。

Result: 实验显示，DTS方法在GSM8K和MATH数据集上分别提升了7.1%和4.2%，且计算开销仅增加1.03倍，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 结构化探索多样化问题解决方法比传统方法更有效，能够生成更高效的偏好数据用于数学对齐。

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM作为角色扮演代理时，其陈述的信念与模拟行为之间的一致性，并提出了评估框架和一致性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM被广泛用于生成合成数据，确保其输出与角色一致成为关键问题。

Method: 通过增强版GenAgents角色库和信任游戏，引入信念-行为一致性度量，分析影响因素。

Result: 发现LLM的信念与模拟行为存在系统性不一致，即使信念看似合理。

Conclusion: 需明确LLM信念与行为的一致性，以合理应用于行为研究。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

Result: 发现固定更新规则与学习规则可能等效，并观察到种群间的共生效应。

Conclusion: 该算法能灵活建模不同博弈场景，展示了其在基准测试中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [10] [Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253)
*Jungkoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2FLOW是一个自动化系统，用于生成自然语言规划问题并评估LLM生成的计划质量，结果显示直接推理优于中间步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型（LLM）规划和推理能力提升中的数据生成和评估瓶颈问题。

Method: 引入NL2FLOW系统，自动生成自然语言规划问题，并以结构化表示和PDDL形式评估计划质量。

Result: 最高性能模型在生成有效计划和最优计划上分别达到86%和69%的成功率；直接推理优于中间步骤。

Conclusion: 动态理解LLM的局限性及系统化工具对释放其作为智能问题解决者的潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

### [11] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了信念修正领域的研究现状，指出现有方法缺乏对能力的分析，而过度依赖语法性质的公设。作者提出需要关注修正机制的能力，如可塑性、平等性和教条性等，并分析了多种修正机制的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信念修正领域的研究主要集中在公设上，这些公设作为语法性质限制了修正机制的具体实例，但忽略了修正机制的能力。作者认为需要关注修正机制的能力，以满足不同应用场景的需求。

Method: 通过分析多种修正机制（如词典式、自然、约束、激进等），作者探讨了它们是否具备可塑性、平等性、教条性等能力。

Result: 研究发现不同的修正机制具备不同的能力，例如某些机制能够实现教条性状态，而另一些则不能。

Conclusion: 信念修正机制的能力分析是重要的研究方向，未来的工作应关注如何设计和评估具备特定能力的修正机制。

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMS框架解决了LLM在关键词生成中的三大限制，无需训练数据，支持多目标优化和自反思，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在赞助搜索广告中的关键词生成存在数据依赖、多目标优化不足和质量控制弱的问题，阻碍了其自动化应用。

Method: 提出OMS框架，具备实时性（无需训练数据）、多目标优化（基于性能指标）和自反思（评估关键词质量）特性。

Result: 在基准测试和实际广告活动中，OMS表现优于现有方法，消融实验和人工评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: OMS框架成功解决了LLM在关键词生成中的关键问题，为自动化广告决策提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Motivation: 探究任务清晰度对大型语言模型推理能力的影响，特别是在定理证明领域。

Method: 引入概念级指标评估任务清晰度，通过结构化语义上下文增强输入，采用Planner-Executor架构和选择性概念展开。

Result: 清晰度得分提升1.85倍（44.5%→82.3%），证明成功率提升2.1倍（21.8%→45.8%），超越之前最佳模型Graph2Tac（33.2%）。

Conclusion: 结构化任务表示能有效弥合理解与推理之间的差距，提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗决策模拟框架多关注单轮任务，与现实诊断过程（不确定、交互式、迭代）不符，需要更动态的模拟方法。

Method: 基于MIMIC-III EHR构建MIMIC-Patient数据集，提出DynamiCare框架，通过多轮交互和多智能体协作模拟临床诊断。

Result: 实验验证了DynamiCare的可行性和有效性，建立了首个动态临床决策的基准。

Conclusion: DynamiCare为LLM驱动的动态临床决策提供了新思路和工具。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

Motivation: 探究LLMs是否能在竞争环境中进行目标推理，验证其战略智能。

Result: LLMs表现优异，展现出独特策略：Gemini冷酷，OpenAI合作，Claude宽容。

Conclusion: LLMs具备战略推理能力，为游戏理论与机器心理学的结合提供了新视角。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）和基于推理的方法在处理复杂信息需求时效率低下，无法有效整合多源知识。

Method: HiRA将复杂任务分解为子任务，由领域特定代理处理，并通过结构化机制协调结果。

Result: 在四个复杂跨模态搜索基准测试中，HiRA显著优于现有RAG和基于代理的系统。

Conclusion: 分层规划与执行的分离在多步信息检索任务中表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TH2T的两阶段微调策略，旨在通过提升长推理模型（LRMs）对任务难度和冗余结构的认知能力，减少过度思考现象。实验表明，该方法显著降低了推理成本，同时保持了性能稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长推理模型（LRMs）在处理复杂推理任务时表现出色，但存在过度思考问题。研究发现，LRMs在解决问题前仅能识别任务属性（如难度），导致推理过程缺乏针对性。因此，研究如何提升LRMs对任务难度和冗余的认知能力，以减少过度思考，成为关键问题。

Method: 提出TH2T两阶段微调策略：1）通过难度催眠（difficulty-hypnosis）在模型输出前缀中干预推理轨迹，结合异构数据集增强模型对任务难度的敏感性；2）通过冗余催眠（redundancy-hypnosis）引导模型识别推理步骤中的冗余结构，生成更简洁的输出。

Result: 在7B/14B/32B模型上的实验表明，TH2T显著降低了推理成本（简单任务减少70%以上，困难任务减少40%），同时保持性能稳定性。输出结果显示出清晰的难度感知能力和减少的冗余。

Conclusion: TH2T通过提升LRMs对任务难度和冗余的认知能力，有效减少了过度思考现象，显著降低了推理成本，为长推理模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

Conclusion: 研究提供了高预测性能和可解释框架，并讨论了如何设计及时干预以减少在线学习中的脱离行为。

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非精确抽象在MCTS中引入近似误差，导致无法收敛到最优动作，因此需要设计安全的抽象丢弃方案。

Method: 提出OGA-IAAD（适用于时间关键场景）和OGA-CAD（提升相同迭代次数下的性能）两种方案。

Result: 新方案在性能提升的同时避免了明显的性能下降。

Conclusion: OGA-IAAD和OGA-CAD是安全且有效的抽象丢弃方案，优于Xu等人的方法。

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在自动定理证明中因稀疏奖励和证明规模大而面临的推理挑战，特别是在复杂多步推理的大学级问题中。

Method: 引入sG-MDPs框架，让代理根据证明状态生成和追求子目标；应用MCTS类算法解决sG-MDP；构建Bourbaki（7B）系统，集成多个7B LLM用于子目标生成和策略合成。

Result: 在PutnamBench上，Bourbaki（7B）解决了26个问题，取得了该规模模型的新最优结果。

Conclusion: sG-MDPs框架结合MCTS算法能有效提升大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

Result: KPE使通用LLMs能够像专家一样分解抽象查询并执行复杂多步任务。

Conclusion: KPE是未来人机协作的基础方法，适用于法律、生物信息学等多个领域。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Conclusion: KERAP为医疗诊断预测提供了一种可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

Result: AI的“不服从”行为可能是伦理推理的早期表现，而非失控或错位。

Conclusion: 呼吁AI安全评估转向能评估伦理判断的框架，避免误判行为并损害公众信任。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Motivation: AI代理能力提升需要更严谨的基准测试，但现有基准存在任务设置或奖励设计问题，导致性能评估不准确。

Method: 提出Agentic Benchmark Checklist（ABC），结合基准构建经验、最佳实践调查和已知问题，用于改进基准测试设计。

Conclusion: ABC能有效减少基准测试中的评估偏差，提升AI代理评估的严谨性。

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

TL;DR: StepHint是一种新的RLVR算法，通过多级逐步提示解决近错奖励问题和探索停滞，提升LLM的训练效率和推理能力。


<details>

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在近错奖励问题和探索停滞，限制了训练效率和模型推理能力的提升。

Method: StepHint利用多级逐步提示，从强模型中生成有效推理链并自适应分区，提供不同级别的提示以引导模型探索。

Result: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于其他RLVR增强方法，并展现出更好的泛化能力和域外表现。

Conclusion: StepHint通过多级提示有效解决了RLVR的关键问题，显著提升了模型的训练效率和推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: LDSolver在粗网格上实现了高效、准确的流体模拟，具有优越的泛化性和性能。

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

Conclusion: DKGCM模型显著提升了交通需求预测的准确性，为资源分配提供了更有效的支持。

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）可以处理约1000帧的输入，但在长视频理解中仍难以有效利用上下文，容易受到无关干扰的影响。

Method: 利用VLM自身迭代识别并提取视频中最相关的帧，用于回答问题。

Result: 在4个不同的视频问答数据集上取得了最先进的结果，尤其在长视频（超过1小时）上表现突出，比标准推理方法提升了2.8分。

Conclusion: 通过推理时计算选择最相关上下文，显著提升了长视频问答的准确性，验证了推理时扩展的有效性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Motivation: 随着图数据规模的扩大，SpGEMM通常在资源受限系统中以out-of-core方式执行，但现有系统存在高I/O延迟和GPU利用率不足的问题。

Method: AIRES通过算法层面的块级数据对齐和分块算法，以及系统层面的三阶段动态调度和双路数据传输策略，优化了out-of-core SpGEMM的计算。

Result: 实验表明，AIRES在真实图处理基准测试中显著优于现有方法，延迟降低高达1.8倍。

Conclusion: AIRES通过算法与系统的协同设计，有效提升了SpGEMM的计算效率，为大规模图数据处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

Conclusion: 结论强调在招聘等高风险领域需使用领域专用模型并进行偏见审计，避免依赖未经充分公平性保障的通用LLM。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时计算技术存在模态或问题特异性，且需要额外监督训练。本文探讨是否可以通过无监督学习实现通用的System 2 Thinking。

Method: 训练EBTs为输入和候选预测对分配能量值，通过梯度下降能量最小化进行预测，适用于离散和连续模态。

Conclusion: EBTs是一种有前景的新范式，可同时提升模型的学习和推理能力。

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Motivation: 探索神经网络训练动态的普适性规律，以理解模型规模、训练算法和数据之间的复杂交互。

Method: 通过归一化训练计算和损失，分析不同模型规模下的损失曲线，并结合学习率衰减和SGD噪声动态模型进行解释。

Result: 发现损失曲线在归一化后可以精确重合（超级重合），且这种现象广泛存在于不同学习率计划、数据集和架构中。

Conclusion: 超级重合现象为神经网络训练的优化提供了精确的实践指标，并揭示了训练动态的普适性规律。

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Result: 实验显示CROP在工业设计中以更少迭代实现更优结果，功耗降低9.9%。

Conclusion: CROP为VLSI设计自动化提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power

Motivation: 生成模型在条件设置下表现优异，但可控性和重建精度限制了其在数据压缩中的实际应用。

Method: 通过变分自编码器和条件扩散模型的结合，仅压缩少量关键帧到潜在空间，并通过生成插值重建其余帧。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在多个数据集上实现了比SZ3高10倍的压缩比，比领先的学习方法性能提升63%。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少存储成本的同时实现了精确的时空重建，为数据压缩提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

Conclusion: NCPNET为时序图提供可靠的共形预测框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

Motivation: 维度降维（DR）投影的评估可能因选择高度相关的指标而产生偏见，导致偏向某些DR技术。

Method: 通过计算指标间的成对相关性聚类指标，减少重叠，并从每个聚类中选择代表性指标。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了DR评估的稳定性，减少了评估偏见。

Conclusion: 提出的流程有助于减少DR评估中的偏见，提升评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

Motivation: 神经网络在求解偏微分方程（PDEs）时存在长期预测误差累积的问题，导致解偏离物理有效性。

Method: 提出PhysicsCorrect框架，通过离线预计算Jacobian及其伪逆，显著降低计算开销，并在每个预测步骤中强制PDE一致性。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes流体动力学、波动方程和Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程等系统中，预测误差降低100倍，推理时间增加不到5%。

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect将不稳定的神经代理转化为可靠的仿真工具，结合了深度学习的高效性和物理保真度。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

Motivation: 当前机器学习领域存在大量性能相似但行为不同的模型，手动比较和文档化这些模型的差异成本过高。

Method: VERBA利用大语言模型采样生成模型差异的文本描述，并通过模拟评估其信息量。

Result: VERBA在决策树模型上能准确描述差异（80%准确率），加入结构信息后提升至90%。

Conclusion: VERBA为提升机器学习模型的透明度和可比性提供了新途径。

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网约车聚合平台的竞争排名机制促使服务提供商采用优惠券策略以降低价格，但现有研究较少，设计动态适应市场波动的优惠券策略是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出FCA-RL框架，结合快速竞争适应（FCA）和强化拉格朗日调整（RLA）技术，并开发了RideGym模拟环境进行策略评估。

Result: 实验表明，FCA-RL在多种市场条件下均优于基线方法，有效优化了补贴策略。

Conclusion: FCA-RL框架为网约车服务提供商提供了一种高效的动态补贴策略解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Result: 在35个任务上的实验表明，URDP能生成更高质量的奖励函数，并显著提升设计效率。

Conclusion: URDP通过结合大语言模型的逻辑推理和贝叶斯优化的数值优化能力，解决了奖励函数设计的效率和质量问题。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: KGZS-SC网络通过知识图谱和零样本学习的结合，有效解决了语义通信中的泛化和效率问题。

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习方法假设数据分布静态，忽视了现实数据流中的概念漂移问题，需要同时保持稳定性和快速适应能力。

Method: 提出AMR方法，选择性移除过时样本并补充新样本，调整记忆缓冲区以匹配新分布。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，AMR能有效应对概念漂移，保持高准确性且计算成本低。

Conclusion: AMR是一种可扩展的解决方案，平衡了非静态环境中的稳定性和可塑性。

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Conclusion: 自蒸馏是解决受限文本生成中学习挑战的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP为临床时间序列解释提供了一种高效、实用的解决方案，适用于实时患者监测。

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习因环境交互成本高而受限，扩散模型虽有效但计算需求大，需更高效方法。

Method: 提出PANI方法，通过噪声注入动作覆盖动作空间，并根据噪声量惩罚，理论支持为噪声动作MDP。

Result: PANI兼容多种离线RL算法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: PANI为离线RL提供高效替代方案，无需复杂模型。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

Motivation: 当前研究仅从结构角度处理子图联邦学习，忽略了图信号在空间和频谱域的传播问题，导致标签信号中断和频谱客户端漂移。

Method: 提出全局知识库缓解标签信号中断，并通过频率对齐解决频谱客户端漂移，形成S2FGL框架。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了S2FGL的优越性。

Conclusion: S2FGL有效解决了联邦图学习中的空间和频谱挑战，提升了全局泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Result: 提出的InfinityKAN方法能够动态学习基函数数量，扩展了KANs的应用范围。

Conclusion: InfinityKAN通过自适应学习基函数，解决了KANs的关键限制，增强了其实际适用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

Motivation: 探索在线共形预测问题中如何同时实现覆盖率和效率，特别是在交换序列和任意序列下的不同表现。

Result: 交换序列下可实现接近最优的覆盖率和长度；任意序列下存在性能限制，但算法能恢复Pareto最优解。

Conclusion: 交换序列和任意序列的表现存在显著差异，算法能有效平衡两者需求。

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

Method: 提出GORP，结合全秩和低秩参数，并在统一的低秩梯度子空间中联合更新，扩展优化空间同时保持效率。

Result: 在持续学习基准测试中，GORP表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: GORP通过创新的训练策略，有效平衡了效率与表达能力，同时减轻了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，分类准确率显著提升，最高达80.22%。

Conclusion: 该方法为无校准运动想象分类设定了新基准，并贡献了开源数据集。

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

TL;DR: RetrySQL是一种新的文本到SQL生成模型训练方法，通过引入自我纠正机制，显著提升了模型的执行准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL任务的研究多依赖黑盒语言模型，缺乏针对SQL的生成模型研究，且自我纠正策略的应用尚未探索。

Method: 通过准备参考SQL查询的推理步骤并故意引入错误，生成包含错误和纠正步骤的数据，用于持续预训练开源编码模型。

Result: RetrySQL在整体和挑战性执行准确性指标上提升了4个百分点，且需全参数预训练而非LoRA微调。

Conclusion: RetrySQL证明了自我纠正机制在文本到SQL任务中的有效性，为SQL导向的语言模型提供了一种新的准确性提升方法。

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

Conclusion: 深入研究组合稀疏性对完善深度学习理论至关重要，甚至可能推动通用智能理论的发展。

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

Result: OmniDraft使单个Llama-68M模型能与多种目标模型配合，速度提升1.5-2倍。

Conclusion: OmniDraft适用于设备端LLM应用，实现了“一个草稿模型适配所有”的范式。

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LN在推理时的作用及其对模型可解释性的影响。

Method: 移除GPT-2模型中的所有LN层，并评估其对验证损失和可解释性的影响。

Result: 移除LN层仅导致验证损失小幅增加（如GPT-2 XL的交叉熵损失+0.03），且不影响语言建模能力。

Conclusion: LN层对语言建模并非必要，移除后可提升模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in

While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition

question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform

faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep

models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced

Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

Conclusion: L-VAE在解缠表示学习中表现优异，适用于多种数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ExPO的新方法，通过结合当前策略和真实答案生成有效样本，解决了传统强化学习后训练在早期阶段和复杂推理任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习后训练方法依赖模型初始能力生成正样本，难以在早期训练或复杂任务中提升推理能力。

Method: 提出了Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)，通过结合当前策略和真实答案生成高质量样本，引导模型探索新的推理路径。

Result: 实验表明，ExPO在推理基准测试中提高了学习效率和最终性能，尤其在MATH level-5等复杂任务中表现优于基于专家演示的方法。

Conclusion: ExPO通过生成更符合策略的高质量样本，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

*Antoine Honoré,Borja Rodríguez Gálvez,Yoomi Park,Yitian Zhou,Volker M. Lauschke,Ming Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的矩阵变分自编码器（matVAE），用于评估蛋白质变体的功能影响，并在DMS数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖多序列比对（MSA），但某些药物基因进化压力低，DMS数据集提供了更直接的适应性评分。

Method: 使用matVAE-MSA模型，结合结构化先验，并在33个DMS数据集上评估性能。

Result: matVAE-MSA在零样本预测中优于DeepSequence，且参数更少、计算量更低；结合AlphaFold结构后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: DMS数据集有望替代MSA，未来需进一步开发DMS数据集以提升变体效应预测。

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于软件工程概念的医疗数据质量评估方法（MDPT），通过自动化测试生成和执行框架，识别并解决EHR数据中的质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据在流行病学研究和AI训练中应用广泛，但其质量问题和现有评估方法的不足影响了研究结果的可靠性。

Method: 采用软件工程中的单元测试和覆盖率概念，开发了MDPT工具，包括自动化测试生成器和数据测试框架。

Result: 在三个数据集上测试，MDPT成功识别了20-43个数据问题，并分析了LLM生成测试套件的准确性和参考基础。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合外部医学知识，提升了数据质量测试的上下文敏感性，为未来改进（如多模态数据和更好的基础方法）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层深度学习框架，用于递归高阶元学习，使神经网络能够构建、解决和泛化任务层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统机器学习依赖人类生成数据的局限性，通过生成虚拟任务和软约束，实现任务的自主生成和泛化。

Method: 采用生成机制创建虚拟任务，通过探索任务空间迭代优化约束区域，并利用范畴论中的函子概念构建分层学习结构。

Result: 框架能够自主生成任务和约束，增强归纳偏置，支持跨任务的抽象和知识转移。

Conclusion: 该架构可能推动下一代神经网络的发展，实现自主生成任务和解决方案，迈向通用人工智能。

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

Method: 提出了一种基于信息论的探索奖励方法，结合稀疏变分高斯过程、深度核和深度集成模型，并设计了PTS-BE框架，将模型规划与信息论奖励结合。

Result: PTS-BE在稀疏奖励和纯探索任务中显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于信息增益的探索提供了理论保证，并通过PTS-BE框架实现了高效的深度探索。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

Result: 在三个跨域基准测试中，DAID在公平性和泛化性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAID通过因果干预有效平衡了公平性与泛化性，验证了其理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决抗体在临床应用中需要同时满足高亲和力、可制造性、稳定性和安全性的问题。

Method: 使用离散扩散模型训练自然抗体序列，并引入SVDD模块引导生成具有高可开发性的候选抗体。

Result: 模型能生成符合自然抗体库和临床抗体特征的序列，且SVDD显著提升了可开发性评分。

Conclusion: 该框架为结合机器学习和高通量实验的抗体设计提供了迭代优化方案。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像中的应用受限于数据稀缺和隐私法规，联邦学习存在通信成本高和任务单一的问题。

Method: 采用差分隐私条件变分自编码器（DP-CVAE）建模全局隐私感知数据分布，支持多样化任务。

Result: 方法在隐私性、可扩展性和效率上优于传统联邦学习，且DP-CVAE比DP-CGAN参数更少、嵌入质量更高。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据隐私和任务多样性的问题，提升了医学影像分析的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多智能体强化学习（MARL）如何改进供应链中的动态定价策略，对比了三种MARL算法与静态规则基准的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ERP系统依赖静态规则定价，忽略了市场参与者间的战略互动，而现有强化学习研究多为单智能体，无法模拟真实供应链的相互依赖性。

Method: 在模拟环境中评估了MADDPG、MADQN和QMIX三种MARL算法，数据来自真实电商交易和LightGBM需求预测模型。

Result: 静态规则代理在公平性和价格稳定性上表现最佳，但缺乏竞争动态；MADQN定价最激进，MADDPG则平衡了市场竞争与公平性。

Conclusion: MARL能引入静态规则无法捕捉的战略行为，为动态定价的未来发展提供参考。

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Motivation: 减少联邦学习中不必要的数据传输成本，同时防止对抗性攻击对全局模型的负面影响。

Method: 提出了一种新的流体民主协议（viscous-retained democracy），并开发了FedVRD算法，动态限制对抗性影响。

Result: FedVRD在相同假设下优于传统1p1v协议，且能有效减少对抗性攻击的影响。

Conclusion: FedVRD是一种高效且安全的联邦学习协议，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法存在早期经验过拟合问题（primacy bias），而人类因婴儿遗忘现象不易受此影响，启发作者设计新算法。

Method: FoG算法包含两个机制：1) 经验回放衰减（ER Decay）逐步减少早期经验影响；2) 网络扩展动态增加参数以提升学习能力。

Result: 在40多个连续控制任务中，FoG表现优于现有SoTA算法（如BRO、SimBa、TD-MPC2）。

Conclusion: FoG通过模仿人类遗忘与学习机制，显著提升了深度强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and

Conclusion: HIPPO为稀疏或多物种不平衡数据下的蛋白质相互作用预测提供了统一框架，并揭示了层次特征融合的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了2-单纯形Transformer架构，通过三线性函数改进标准点积注意力，证明其在固定token预算下比标准Transformer更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型依赖海量数据，但现有扩展定律假设无限数据且适用于计算受限场景，需提升token效率。

Method: 提出2-单纯形Transformer，通过Triton内核实现三线性函数，替代标准点积注意力。

Result: 在数学、编码、推理和逻辑任务中，相同规模模型表现优于标准Transformer，改变了知识任务的扩展定律指数。

Conclusion: 2-单纯形Transformer显著提升token效率，为计算非受限场景下的模型优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

TL;DR: 研究了在带有偏差离线数据的情境下在线定价问题，提出了基于乐观面对不确定性（OFU）的策略，并给出了最优的遗憾边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在离线数据存在偏差的情况下，如何优化在线定价策略的问题。

Method: 提出了OFU策略，并针对标量价格弹性和一般价格弹性分别设计了算法。

Result: 对于标量价格弹性，给出了实例依赖的遗憾边界；对于一般价格弹性，给出了最坏情况下的最优遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 该研究为带有偏差离线数据的上下文定价问题提供了首个紧密的遗憾保证，并可推广到带有偏差离线数据的随机线性bandit问题。

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

*Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了循环模型在长度泛化上的失败原因，并提出简单训练干预方法以提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环模型在处理长序列时性能下降，无法泛化到超出训练上下文长度的序列。

Method: 通过增加训练期间模型状态覆盖的干预措施，如高斯噪声初始化或使用其他序列的最终状态。

Result: 仅用少量额外训练步骤，模型能泛化到比训练上下文长多个数量级的序列（如2k到128k）。

Conclusion: 提出的干预方法简单高效，能显著提升循环模型的长度泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

TL;DR: GRADUATE模型通过多校准优化解决了生存分析中少数子群体校准不足的问题，平衡了校准与区分度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生存模型通常仅在群体层面校准，可能导致少数子群体校准不足，影响临床决策。

Method: GRADUATE将多校准问题转化为约束优化问题，优化校准与区分度。

Result: 理论证明优化方法高效可行，实验验证其在真实临床数据集上的优越性。

Conclusion: GRADUATE在多校准和区分度平衡方面优于现有基线模型。

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Conclusion: 结论表明该研究为可重复分布测试提供了理论基础和实用工具，解决了先前工作中的开放性问题。

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

<details>

Motivation: 临床实践中，训练数据和推断数据的不一致可能导致治疗效应估计偏差，影响个性化医疗决策。

Method: 提出新框架，利用大型语言模型和双重稳健学习器，解决推断时的文本混杂问题。

Result: 实验证明，该框架在真实场景中能有效减少偏差。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床实践中的治疗效应估计提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提取和利用fMRI数据中的高阶相互作用（HOIs）方面存在挑战，影响诊断准确性。

Method: 提出MvHo-IB框架，结合信息论中的O信息和Renyi熵估计器量化HOIs，设计Brain3DCNN编码器，并引入多视图学习信息瓶颈目标。

Result: 在三个基准fMRI数据集上，MvHo-IB表现优于现有方法，包括最新的超图技术。

Conclusion: MvHo-IB通过有效建模HOIs和压缩冗余信息，显著提升了诊断性能。

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is
available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多任务中文偏见评估基准（McBE），以解决现有偏见评估数据集在语言、文化和任务多样性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的偏见问题日益凸显，但现有评估数据集主要针对英语和北美文化，且任务单一，缺乏中文和文化多样性支持。

Method: 构建了包含4,077个偏见评估实例的McBE基准，涵盖12个偏见类别、82个子类别和5种评估任务。

Result: 评估了多个流行的LLM，发现它们均表现出不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: McBE为LLM的偏见评估提供了更全面的工具，揭示了偏见问题的新见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

Motivation: 对话摘要在实际应用中具有重要价值，但推理型大语言模型（如链式思维模型）在此任务中的表现尚未被系统研究。

Method: 通过全面评估推理型和非推理型大语言模型在三种对话摘要范式（通用、角色导向和查询导向）中的表现，使用多种基准数据集和评估协议。

Result: 研究发现，推理型模型在对话摘要中并未表现出优势，反而容易产生冗长和不一致的摘要。

Conclusion: 当前推理型大语言模型在对话摘要中存在局限性，需针对实际应用场景优化建模和评估策略。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

Motivation: 探索深度循环Transformer是否能在潜在空间中实现链式思维推理，以提高效率。

Result: 发现潜在链式思维推理的证据有限，且推理深度增加效果微弱。

Conclusion: 显式外部化推理步骤的模型仍优于潜在推理方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

Method: 开发并评估了多个大型语言模型（LLMs），本地部署的开源GDC Cohort LLM在生成GDC队列时表现优于GPT-4o。

Result: GDC Cohort Copilot能够根据用户的自然语言描述自动生成队列过滤器，并通过交互式界面进一步优化队列。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot通过自然语言交互简化了队列创建流程，提高了用户体验和效率。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

Result: DoMIX在持续DAP中表现高效且鲁棒，并能扩展到标准LLM微调场景。

Conclusion: DoMIX通过LoRA模块解决了持续DAP的挑战，并展示了其广泛适用性。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

Motivation: FFN模块在Transformer中占主导参数，PQC可提升表达能力和参数效率。

Method: 设计包含残差连接、旋转门和交替纠缠策略的PQC架构，替代BERT的FFN模块。

Result: 在SST-2和DBpedia基准测试中，QFFN-BERT性能超越经典模型，减少99%参数，并在少样本学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: PQC可作为高效替代方案，与深度学习原则协同设计时表现出色。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled

TL;DR: 研究评估了七种基于Transformer架构的Akan ASR模型在多样化语音上下文中的泛化能力，发现模型性能高度依赖训练领域，并揭示了Whisper与Wav2Vec2在错误行为上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR研究多关注领域内数据集，缺乏对多样化语音上下文泛化能力的评估，本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 使用四种Akan语音语料库（涵盖文化描述、非正式对话、圣经诵读和金融对话）对七种Transformer架构的ASR模型进行基准测试，比较词错误率和字符错误率。

Result: 模型在训练领域表现最佳，但在不匹配场景中准确性显著下降；Whisper产生更流畅但可能误导的错误，Wav2Vec2错误更明显但不易解释。

Conclusion: 研究强调需针对低资源语言开发领域适应技术、自适应路由策略和多语言训练框架，并需权衡ASR错误的可读性与透明性。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Motivation: 超越人类认知限制是LLM训练的关键前沿，专有代理系统（如DeepResearch）在复杂信息搜索任务中表现出超人类能力，开源模型缺乏这种能力。

Method: 提出WebSailor方法，包括生成高不确定性任务、RFT冷启动和DUPO算法。

Result: WebSailor在复杂信息搜索任务中显著优于所有开源代理，性能接近专有代理。

Conclusion: WebSailor填补了开源模型与专有代理之间的能力差距，为LLM训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了标签变异（LV）和人类标签变异（HLV）在监督学习中的重要性，并提出了一个结合HLV的主动学习（AL）框架，以优化标注预算的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量标注数据的获取是监督学习的瓶颈，而标签变异（尤其是人类标签变异HLV）常被忽视。论文旨在分解标签变异为信号（HLV）和噪声（标注错误），并优化主动学习框架以更好地反映真实标注的复杂性。

Method: 论文提出了一种概念框架，将HLV融入主动学习的各个环节，包括实例选择、标注者选择和标签表示，并探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）作为标注者的整合。

Result: 论文为HLV感知的主动学习奠定了概念基础，更好地反映了真实世界标注的复杂性。

Conclusion: 通过分解标签变异并优化主动学习框架，论文为处理真实标注中的复杂性和不确定性提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

TL;DR: MPF是一种新颖的后训练对齐框架，用于减轻大语言模型（LLM）的偏见，通过多视角生成和基线分解实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM输出中的偏见问题，提供一种无需大量提示工程或微调的可扩展方法。

Method: 利用SAGED管道构建偏见基准，分解基线为可解释的视角组件，通过采样和平衡响应进行对齐。

Result: MPF成功将LLM情感分布与反事实基线和HR基线对齐，减小KL散度，降低校准误差，并泛化到未见问题。

Conclusion: MPF提供了一种可扩展且可解释的对齐和偏见缓解方法，适用于已部署的LLM。

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a

Conclusion: LimitGen为LLM辅助同行评审提供了首个全面基准，有望缓解评审压力并提升评审质量。

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

Motivation: 探索人类元音模仿的精确控制机制，填补关于子音位水平控制准确性的知识空白。

Method: 采用元音模仿范式，测量两组英语使用者在元音模仿中的最小可感知差异（JPD）。

Result: JPD在F1 X F2空间中的估计值为14至51 mels。

Conclusion: 研究为语音产生的片段理论提供了支持，并为元音系统的可能结构设定了理论下限。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在自我纠正能力上的系统性缺陷，以提高其可靠性和可信度。

Method: 引入Self-Correction Bench框架，通过控制错误注入测试14个模型，分析盲点率及影响因素。

Result: 平均盲点率为64.5%，训练数据构成是主要限制因素，添加“Wait”可减少盲点89.3%。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs的自我纠正盲点，提出了改进方向，如调整训练数据或激活机制。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

TL;DR: 研究发现，具备推理能力的语言模型（RLMs）在对抗社会偏见方面可能比无推理能力的模型更脆弱，推理机制可能无意中强化刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理能力对语言模型在偏见和安全性的影响，明确推理机制是否真的能提升模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用CLEAR-Bias基准评估RLMs，结合LLM-as-a-judge自动评分和越狱技术测试安全性。

Result: 推理能力模型（尤其是CoT提示）比无推理能力的模型更容易引发偏见，推理可能增加刻板印象的传播。

Conclusion: 推理能力并不天然提升鲁棒性，需设计更注重偏见的推理机制。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在数学推理中依赖单一图像-文本对和单解监督，忽视了多样化的解题视角和内部反思。

Method: 引入MathV-DP数据集，提供多样化解题轨迹；基于Qwen-VL构建Qwen-VL-DP模型，结合监督学习和GRPO强化学习优化。

Result: 在MathVista和Math-V基准测试中，Qwen-VL-DP在准确性和生成多样性上显著优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: 多样化解题视角和反思性推理对多模态数学推理至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: 平衡大语言模型的性能与运营成本，解决高成本推理模式与低成本非思考模式之间的选择问题。

Method: 提出SynapseRoute框架，基于机器学习动态分配查询到思考或非思考模式。

Result: 实验显示SynapseRoute提升准确率（0.8390 vs. 0.8272），减少推理时间36.8%，节省39.66%的token消耗。

Conclusion: 动态路由可避免过度推理，优化性能与成本，提出AIT指数综合评估准确性、延迟和token成本。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Result: RLVR显著提升了模型精确遵循指令的能力，并发布了新训练数据和工具。

Conclusion: 通过IFBench和RLVR，模型在精确指令遵循上的泛化能力得到显著提升。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示基于用户反馈训练的LM的潜在安全风险，展示攻击者如何利用有限权限（如投票反馈）持久改变模型行为。

Method: 攻击者通过提示模型随机输出“有毒”或良性响应，并通过投票反馈（如点赞有毒响应或点踩良性响应）操纵模型。随后偏好调整会放大有毒响应的概率。

Result: 攻击可实现（1）插入模型未知的事实知识，（2）修改代码生成模式以引入安全漏洞，（3）注入虚假金融新闻。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了偏好调整的新特性（即有限反馈数据可精细控制模型行为），并扩展了LM训练时的攻击机制（如数据投毒和提示注入）。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

TL;DR: 论文指出传统多项选择题评测的局限性，提出生成式评测方法（答案匹配），并证明其与人工评分一致性高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项选择题评测存在缺陷，如无需看题即可作答，限制了评测的准确性。

Method: 采用生成式评测方法（答案匹配），即模型生成自由回答，再由现代语言模型与参考答案匹配。

Result: 答案匹配方法（尤其是使用现代模型）与人工评分一致性接近完美，而多项选择和LLM评分一致性较差。

Conclusion: 建议从多项选择转向答案匹配评测方法，以提高评测准确性。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

### [122] [Subtyping in DHOL -- Extended preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02855)
*Colin Rothgang,Florian Rabe*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: DHOL通过牺牲类型系统的可判定性来增强表达能力，同时保留自动化定理证明支持。本文扩展了DHOL，增加了精化和商类型，这些类型在实践中需求高但难以实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实践中对精化和商类型的需求，这些类型在自动化定理证明器中难以实现，因为需要不可判定的类型系统。

Method: 将精化和商类型作为子类型的特例添加，避免表示上的昂贵更改，并提供了语法、语义及到HOL的翻译。

Result: 成功扩展了DHOL，支持精化和商类型，并证明了其语法、语义及翻译的正确性。

Conclusion: 通过DHOL的设计，精化和商类型的添加不仅可能，而且优雅简单，为自动化定理证明提供了更强的表达能力。

Abstract: The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an
interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It
sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend
its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem
proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types.
Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by
automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable
typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But
with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but
elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of
subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps
into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present
the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,
including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态LLM的合成启发式评估方法，用于低成本、高效地识别可用性问题，性能优于人类评估者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可用性评估成本高，需要专家和用户参与，因此探索利用LLM的潜力降低评估成本。

Method: 开发了一种合成启发式评估方法，利用多模态LLM分析图像并提供设计反馈，并与人类评估者对比。

Result: 合成评估识别了73%和77%的可用性问题，优于人类评估者（57%和63%），但在识别UI组件和设计惯例方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 合成评估在特定任务中表现优于人类，但仍有改进空间，为未来设计合成启发式评估提供了参考。

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly,
requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed
stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences
between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic
heuristic evaluations.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成情感丰富对话时的表现，发现情感建模需结合自动化与人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对话代理在多个领域的广泛应用，情感智能（尤其是共情倾听）的需求日益增长。

Method: 使用ChatGPT和Gemini扩展专家手工制作的小数据集，通过VADER情感分析和专家评估分析对话情感进展。

Result: 生成的对话虽能反映情感结构，但人类评估发现共情和连贯性存在差异。

Conclusion: 情感建模需结构对齐和深度结合，强调开发情感智能代理时需结合自动化与人工方法。

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding
their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 数据科学家通过拼凑过程构建预测模型的目标变量，涉及高层测量目标与低层实际约束的迭代协商，以满足有效性、简单性、可预测性、可移植性和资源需求等标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据科学家如何将模糊概念转化为具体代理目标变量的过程，目前这一过程尚不明确。

Method: 访谈了15位来自教育（8人）和医疗（7人）领域的数据科学家，分析其构建目标变量的方法。

Result: 发现数据科学家通过拼凑过程构建目标变量，使用问题重构策略（如替换或组合变量）以满足五大标准。

Conclusion: 为未来HCI、CSCW和ML研究提供了支持目标变量构建的机会。

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HyFairCRS的新框架，旨在解决动态对话推荐系统中的不公平问题，通过超图对比多兴趣学习提升多样性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中的不公平问题（如性别、种族、年龄或流行度偏见）在动态交互环境中可能加剧，导致马太效应、过滤气泡和回声室效应。

Method: HyFairCRS通过对比学习建立多样化的超图捕捉用户兴趣，并在对话中利用这些兴趣生成公平的推荐。

Result: 在两个CRS数据集上的实验表明，HyFairCRS在性能上达到新高度，并有效缓解不公平问题。

Conclusion: HyFairCRS为动态对话推荐系统中的公平性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在固定曲率和刚性嵌入上的局限性，支持更灵活的语义探索和推理。

Method: 使用自适应曲率概率球表示用户、物品和标签，结合曲率感知语义核进行多跳推理。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中，NDCG、校准和多样性表现优于基线。

Conclusion: ManifoldMind提供透明、可信的推荐，适用于稀疏或抽象领域。

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or
abstract domains.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在信息检索中广泛用于标注文档相关性，但不同模型在边缘案例上存在分歧，影响下游检索效果。

Method: 研究分析了LLaMA和Qwen在可持续目标相关学术摘要上的标注分歧，考察了词汇特性、排序行为和分类可预测性。

Result: 模型分歧具有系统性，表现为一致的词汇模式、不同的排名输出，且可通过简单分类器区分（AUC>0.74）。

Conclusion: LLM过滤在文档检索中引入结构化变异性，建议将分类分歧作为检索评估的分析对象，特别是在政策相关任务中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document
relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains
lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on
borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects
downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two
open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement
subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and
classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is
systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns,
produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are
distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings
suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document
retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose
using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval
evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

Result: 内容过滤能有效缓解协作过滤的偏差，但不同分析方法间可能存在冲突。

Conclusion: 论文提出未来研究方向，以优化音乐推荐系统的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

Motivation: 现有推荐系统中的偏好对齐方法需要显式奖励建模或仅支持成对偏好比较，前者计算成本高，后者训练效率低，且缺乏对尾部物品推荐的解决方案。

Method: 扩展Bradley-Terry模型至列表式比较，推导闭式最优策略避免显式奖励建模，并提出自适应负采样和重加权策略优化尾部物品推荐。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，LPO4Rec显著优于10个基线方法，尾部物品推荐性能提升高达50%，GPU内存使用减少17.9%。

Conclusion: LPO4Rec通过列表式偏好优化，高效解决了偏好对齐问题，尤其在尾部物品推荐中表现优异。

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations,
we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily
polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are
suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that
combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design
to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate
optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification,
leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to
existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings
with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the
expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive
random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the
adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies
on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the knowledge transfer under the setting of matrix
completion, which aims to enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix
with auxiliary data available. We propose a transfer learning procedure given
prior information on which source datasets are favorable. We study its
convergence rates and prove its minimax optimality. Our analysis reveals that
with the source matrices close enough to the target matrix, out method
outperforms the traditional method using the single target data. In particular,
we leverage the advanced sharp concentration inequalities introduced in
\cite{brailovskaya2024universality} to eliminate a logarithmic factor in the
convergence rate, which is crucial for proving the minimax optimality. When the
relevance of source datasets is unknown, we develop an efficient detection
procedure to identify informative sources and establish its selection
consistency. Simulations and real data analysis are conducted to support the
validity of our methodology.

Conclusion: 治疗噪声分布对估计效果有显著影响，新方法在非高斯噪声下具有更高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a
treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance
functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we
find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the
treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of
\citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine
learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise,
resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for
independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal
by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to
nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant
estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever
the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results
with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear
model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate
the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.

Conclusion: 块对角结构和PEP框架为稀疏高斯过程提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Inducing-point-based sparse variational Gaussian processes have become the
standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these
methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the
conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first
considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling
matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the
unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP)
and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate
posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed
block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than
existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational
costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides
competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering
practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding
traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use,
traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities
of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning
techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price
prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents
DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels
using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and
market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature
engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving
market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust
representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through
unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price
thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that
DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy
and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market
conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a
scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach
highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced
market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial
applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm
relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The
advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream
task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock
prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3)
Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective
comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we
propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph
Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship
graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing
graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance.
Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available
on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: LSTM模型适用于金融时间序列预测，未来可结合其他技术优化模型。

Abstract: Investors and stock market analysts face major challenges in predicting stock
returns and making wise investment decisions. The predictability of equity
stock returns can boost investor confidence, but it remains a difficult task.
To address this issue, a study was conducted using a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) model to predict future stock market movements. The study used a
historical dataset from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which was cleaned
and normalized to design the LSTM model. The model was evaluated using
performance metrics and compared with other deep learning models like
Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The experimental results
showed that the LSTM model can predict future stock market prices and returns
with over 90% accuracy when trained with a reliable dataset. The study
concludes that LSTM models can be useful in predicting financial
time-series-related problems if well-trained. Future studies should explore
combining LSTM models with other deep learning techniques like CNN to create
hybrid models that mitigate the risks associated with relying on a single model
for future equity stock predictions.

Abstract: This paper will discuss how headline data can be used to predict stock
prices. The stock price in question is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, also known
as SPY that tracks the performance of the largest 500 publicly traded
corporations in the United States. A key focus is to use news headlines from
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to predict the movement of stock prices on a
daily timescale with OpenAI-based text embedding models used to create vector
encodings of each headline with principal component analysis (PCA) to exact the
key features. The challenge of this work is to capture the time-dependent and
time-independent, nuanced impacts of news on stock prices while handling
potential lag effects and market noise. Financial and economic data were
collected to improve model performance; such sources include the U.S. Dollar
Index (DXY) and Treasury Interest Yields. Over 390 machine-learning inference
models were trained. The preliminary results show that headline data embeddings
greatly benefit stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to training and
optimizing a machine learning system without headline data embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融欺诈每年造成巨额损失，但传统机器学习方法因数据稀疏性和模型不透明性难以有效应用。

Method: 提出SAGE-FIN，结合半监督图神经网络和Granger因果关系，利用弱标记或无标记数据检测欺诈。

Result: 在真实数据集Elliptic++上验证了SAGE-FIN的优越性能，并能提供Granger因果解释。

Conclusion: SAGE-FIN有效解决了金融欺诈检测中的数据稀疏性和解释性问题。

Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually.
Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task
that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning
(ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not
so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes
the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and
(2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML
models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes
SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with
Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns
to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points.
To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by
highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We
empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world
dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++),
with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without
any prior assumption on the network structure.

TL;DR: AC-Refiner是一种基于条件扩散模型的算术电路优化框架，通过将电路合成任务转化为条件图像生成任务，显著提升了设计质量和Pareto最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算术电路（如加法器和乘法器）对数字系统的性能、功耗和面积有直接影响，但优化这些电路因设计空间大和物理约束复杂而具有挑战性。现有深度学习方法难以高效探索高潜力设计变体。

Method: 提出AC-Refiner框架，利用条件扩散模型，将算术电路合成任务转化为条件图像生成任务，并通过目标质量结果（QoRs）指导去噪扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明，AC-Refiner生成的电路设计具有更高的Pareto最优性，优于现有基线方法，并在实际应用中验证了其性能优势。

Conclusion: AC-Refiner通过条件扩散模型有效优化算术电路设计，显著提升了设计质量和优化效率。

Abstract: Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental
components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power
efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains
challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints.
While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their
optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a
novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional
diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as
a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising
diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently
produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are
used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the
Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates
designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner
into practical applications.

Motivation: 当前生成语音系统中，声音身份通常通过ASV嵌入评估，但这些嵌入设计用于区分而非全面表征身份。研究旨在揭示ASV嵌入的局限性，并改进声音身份的评估方法。

Method: 分析了ASV嵌入对声音特征的捕捉能力，发现其忽略动态节奏。提出了U3D指标来评估动态节奏模式，并提出了缓解混淆因素的策略。

Result: ASV嵌入主要关注静态特征，动态节奏被忽视。U3D指标能有效评估动态节奏，弥补现有方法的不足。

Conclusion: ASV嵌入在声音身份评估中存在局限性，U3D指标为动态节奏提供了新的评估方法，有助于提升声音克隆系统的身份一致性评估。

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

Motivation: 标准Transformer的注意力机制会将部分注意力权重分配给无关信息，可能损害模型的判别能力。

Method: 引入了差分注意力机制，结合双软最大操作和调优差分系数，优化注意力分配。

Result: ASDA在音频分类（AS-2M上49.0% mAP，AS20K上41.5% mAP）、关键词识别（SPC-2上98.3%准确率）和环境声音分类（ESC-50上96.1%准确率）中表现优异。

Conclusion: ASDA在音频任务中表现出色，为更广泛应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio

Result: 该方法提供了系统性能信息，优化了训练，并能够建模检测距离，从而评估声音环境对检测动态的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为动物种群监测中的信号检测系统提供了更全面的性能评估和优化工具。

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有净化方法，能更有效地破坏VC防御。

Conclusion: 对抗性扰动防御存在局限性，亟需更鲁棒的方法应对VC带来的安全和隐私风险。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

Result: 在WSJ0-QUT和VoiceBank-DEMAND数据集上，增强指标和领域适应性优于监督和非监督基线。

Conclusion: 新方法在语音增强中表现更优，且更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

Result: 证明了包括第一价格和全支付拍卖在内的一大类拍卖中，BCE可以通过多项式数量的样本学习。

Conclusion: BCE的学习在非真实拍卖中是可行的，且样本复杂度可控。

Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

Method: 提出MetaFO，一个受大型语言模型启发的贝叶斯变换器基础模型，学习超材料的基本力学，实现跨多样性的零样本预测和非线性逆向设计。

Result: MetaFO在分布外条件下表现出色，揭示了复杂的结构-性能关系，并显著扩展了设计空间。

Conclusion: MetaFO为AI驱动的超材料发现提供了可扩展和通用的框架，标志着该领域的范式转变。

Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.

TL;DR: 结合AutoML和XAI预测焊接横向加劲细节的疲劳强度，通过专家特征与算法特征的结合提升准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决焊接结构疲劳强度预测的准确性和可解释性问题，结合专家知识与自动化方法。

Method: 使用AutoML训练回归模型（梯度提升、随机森林、神经网络），比较三种特征方案（专家驱动、算法生成、混合），并应用XAI方法（SHAP和特征重要性）分析。

Result: 模型M2在测试中表现最佳（RMSE≈30.6 MPa，R²≈0.780），XAI识别出应力比、应力范围、屈服强度等为主要预测因子。

Conclusion: AutoML与XAI结合可提供准确、可解释的疲劳强度模型，未来将探索概率建模和数字孪生集成。

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict
fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates
expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance
accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient
boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under
three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed
a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The
domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE
$\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta
\sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527%
within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model
($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,
while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,
confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress
range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG
dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -
plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected
fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不确定非线性系统在有限扰动和未建模非线性影响下的控制问题。

Method: 使用高斯过程学习不确定动态，并结合收缩度量生成鲁棒预测，融入MPC框架。

Result: 设计保证了递归可行性、鲁棒约束满足和高概率收敛到参考状态，数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过鲁棒预测和在线学习显著提升了控制性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and adaptive model predictive control
(MPC) framework for uncertain nonlinear systems affected by bounded
disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. We use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to
learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those
collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust
predictions for GP models using contraction metrics, which are incorporated in
the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility,
robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high
probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to
difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements
achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online
learning.

Result: 在真实投资组合优化矩阵上的评估表明，该框架显著加速了收敛并降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出的加速求解器支持动态投资组合分配和实时期权定价中的更快决策。

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing
block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization
and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the
discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large
linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion
of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant
computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for
portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer
from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require
problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL
to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative
solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization
matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust
preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce
computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster
decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

Conclusion: 结论强调了文本分析在精细专利分类中的重要性，为政策制定提供了实用工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

Motivation: 开放银行的出现改变了金融数据管理，金融机构需平衡数据流入和流出以提升竞争力。研究旨在预测客户数据共享行为，为机构提供战略洞察。

Method: 使用巴西金融机构的320万客户数据，结合ADASYN和NEARMISS技术平衡数据，训练XGBoost模型预测数据共享行为，并通过SHAP和CART技术进行解释性分析。

Result: 模型预测准确率达91.39%（流入）和91.53%（流出）。关键特征包括移动渠道交易、互动和信用相关特征（如信用卡使用）。

Conclusion: 移动渠道参与和信用特征是客户数据共享行为的主要驱动因素，为金融机构在开放银行环境中提升竞争力提供了战略依据。

Abstract: The emergence of Open Banking represents a significant shift in financial
data management, influencing financial institutions' market dynamics and
marketing strategies. This increased competition creates opportunities and
challenges, as institutions manage data inflow to improve products and services
while mitigating data outflow that could aid competitors. This study introduces
a framework to predict customers' propensity to share data via Open Banking and
interprets this behavior through Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA). Using data
from a large Brazilian financial institution with approximately 3.2 million
customers, a hybrid data balancing strategy incorporating ADASYN and NEARMISS
techniques was employed to address the infrequency of data sharing and enhance
the training of XGBoost models. These models accurately predicted customer data
sharing, achieving 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow. The EMA
phase combined the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method with the
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique, revealing the most
influential features on customer decisions. Key features included the number of
transactions and purchases in mobile channels, interactions within these
channels, and credit-related features, particularly credit card usage across
the national banking system. These results highlight the critical role of
mobile engagement and credit in driving customer data-sharing behaviors,
providing financial institutions with strategic insights to enhance
competitiveness and innovation in the Open Banking environment.

Motivation: 监控LLM输出对减少滥用和错位风险至关重要，但LLM可能通过隐写术逃避监控。

Method: 评估LLM在两种隐写术（传递编码消息和执行编码推理）中的能力。

Result: 当前模型在标准条件下难以隐藏消息，但在额外条件下可能成功；初步显示出隐写推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的隐写能力尚不成熟，但未来可能发展出更强的能力。

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）降低了软件开发的门槛，但也可能被用于恶意软件开发。现有对齐机制仅评估单个提示，忽视了恶意操作可分解为看似无害的子任务的风险。

Method: 引入Malware Generation Compiler（MGC）框架，使用Malware Description Intermediate Representation（MDIR）将高级恶意意图与无害代码片段连接。

Result: MGC在三个基准数据集上生成功能恶意软件的正确率比越狱方法高365.79%，比地下服务高78.07%，并能复现并增强16个真实恶意软件样本。

Conclusion: MGC暴露了组合攻击对齐AI系统的风险，为安全研究人员提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

Method: 通过分析学术文献和实践案例，评估AI技术（如异常检测、语言事实提取、动态声誉建模和对抗性抵抗）在预言机系统中的应用。

Result: AI能提升数据质量、来源选择和系统韧性，但无法消除对不可验证链外输入的依赖。

Conclusion: AI应被视为预言机设计中的补充层，而非信任假设的替代品。

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

Method: 利用DRAM单元的RowHammer扰动作为熵源，设计EIM-TRNG框架，结合固定和随机比特翻转加密数据。

Result: 验证了DRAM熵提取的有效性，为低成本硬件安全提供解决方案。

Conclusion: EIM-TRNG为机器学习模型硬件级保护提供了新方向。

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

Motivation: 传统IDS/IPS系统生成大量警报，机器学习和标准RAG方法存在高误报率和无关上下文的缺陷，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用模块化代理框架，结合微调分类器、工具适配器和迭代检索推理循环，动态优化威胁标签和解释。

Conclusion: CyberRAG通过代理设计和语义协调，实现了高检测准确性和可解释性，为半自主网络防御提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

Method: 调查用户对厨房清洁机器人解释需求和内容的偏好，提出两种算法识别意外行为并构建解释，适用于BDI机器人。

Conclusion: 提出的算法易于集成到BDI推理中，为上下文和用户定制解释提供了基础，优化人机交互。

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

Motivation: 传统采样规划计算成本高，而完全监督方法仅模仿轨迹，无法确保目标达成。因此，提出自监督学习方案，以更高效地生成适应性强的轨迹。

Result: 模型能够仅通过给定的运动学模型学习生成轨迹，适用于复杂任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂任务的自适应规划提供了新思路，具有潜力。

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度去噪自编码器（DDAE）的高效路径规划方法SkelUnet，用于快速生成骨架化导航地图，并在无人机模拟环境中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统骨架化算法资源消耗大且主要用于图像处理，而路径规划需要平衡响应时间、安全性和路径长度。因此，需要一种高效的方法来生成骨架化地图。

Method: 使用基于U-Net架构的深度去噪自编码器（DDAE）SkelUnet，通过一次性采样（OSS）生成骨架化地图，替代传统迭代或概率采样方法。

Result: 在12,500张二维地牢地图上训练和测试SkelUnet，并在250张未见地图上评估无人机路径规划。结果显示SkelUnet能连接所有自由空间区域，提供更安全的路径并减少处理时间。

Conclusion: SkelUnet方法在结构化环境中特别适用于移动服务机器人，因其高效性和安全性优势。

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

Motivation: 研究动物行为如何从神经活动中产生是神经科学的基础目标，但大规模哺乳动物大脑的复杂性带来了挑战。LLMs因其序列学习能力可能适用于神经解码。

Method: 使用预训练的LLMs（如DeepSeek Coder-7b）解码斑马鱼全脑钙成像数据与行为记录，验证其在神经解码中的表现。

Result: 预训练的LLMs在神经解码中表现更优，DeepSeek Coder-7b显著提高了行为解码准确性，并提供了可解释的神经元重要性分析。

Conclusion: NLP4Neuro证明LLMs能有效辅助全脑神经环路解析，为神经科学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Delineating how animal behavior arises from neural activity is a foundational
goal of neuroscience. However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold
in networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this
presents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms
in large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the
backbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools
for neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have
benefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning
has been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also
confer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity
recordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to
decode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to
test LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval
zebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that
LLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned
from textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent
mixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral
decoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided
anatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience.
NLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide
neural circuit dissection.

Motivation: 小型组织和初创公司缺乏法律专业知识，手动提取法律文本的元数据以确保合规性是一项繁重任务。现有自动化方法未能充分考虑元数据间的关联性，且依赖手动标注或启发式机器学习，泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用文本蕴含和上下文学习技术，设计了一个领域特定的元模型（Python类结构），捕捉法律文本的结构和语义元数据及其相互关系，生成可编码为Python代码的规范表示。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了对手动标注数据的依赖，提高了对新法规的适用性，为法律合规性自动化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

Result: LLM生成的问题在清晰度、相关性和信息量上不劣于人工问题，且在错误类型指导下表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMs可实时提升需求访谈质量，减轻访谈者负担。

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

Conclusion: VeFIA是首个解决VFL中推理软件执行正确性审计的框架，具有高效和隐私保护的特点。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI

Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional
approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such
as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in
deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled
data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined
structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by
their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs
larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these
challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel
framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate
graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the
dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and
subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation.
Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for
standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the
tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent
structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating
robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: LiTEN是一种新型的等变神经网络，通过Tensorized Quadrangle Attention（TQA）高效建模三体和四体相互作用，实现了QM级精度的生物分子模拟，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物分子模拟方法（如经典力场和QM方法）在精度和效率上存在显著不足，AI力场（AIFFs）虽具潜力但受限于建模复杂性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出LiTEN框架，采用TQA技术以线性复杂度高效建模多体相互作用，并基于nablaDFT数据集预训练LiTEN-FF模型，再通过SPICE数据集微调。

Result: LiTEN在rMD17、MD22和Chignolin等基准测试中表现最优，比MACE-OFF快10倍，支持多种下游任务如构象搜索和自由能面构建。

Conclusion: LiTEN为复杂生物分子建模提供了高效且物理基础扎实的解决方案，适用于药物发现等领域。

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism
understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation
methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient
but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details
critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)
methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or
long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level
accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,
accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and
insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle
Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with
linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector
operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is
a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset
for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated
system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across
most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading
models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most
comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,
including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy
surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for
large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,
highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,
providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

TL;DR: SynTwins是一种新型的逆合成引导分子类似物设计框架，通过模拟专家化学家策略生成可合成的分子类似物，解决了AI生成分子与合成可行性之间的脱节问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的分子虽然具有理想性质，但其合成可行性成为计算药物和材料发现的关键瓶颈。

Method: SynTwins采用三步法：逆合成、相似构建块搜索和虚拟合成，设计可合成的分子类似物。

Result: 在比较评估中，SynTwins在生成可合成类似物方面优于现有机器学习模型，同时保持与目标分子的高结构相似性。

Conclusion: SynTwins有效弥合了计算设计与实验合成之间的差距，为加速发现具有理想性质的可合成分子提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and
their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug
and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of
candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible
to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce
SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that
designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist
strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block
searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins
demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible
analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining
high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when
integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach
produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to
unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our
comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that
SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and
experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the
discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range
of applications.

Conclusion: NQS是解决复杂多费米子系统的强大工具，尤其在捕捉长程相关性和纠缠方面表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a
promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by
leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing
highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art
results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum
model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention
heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled
stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest
neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.
Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging
many-fermions systems.

TL;DR: 论文研究了毫米波MIMO系统中预编码设计，利用RIS增强传输性能，提出基于DNN的快速码字选择方法，降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统穷举搜索在连续相位偏移下计算量大且耗时，需一种高效方法优化码本设计。

Method: 采用排列离散傅里叶变换向量设计码本，并开发训练DNN以加速码字选择。

Result: 仿真显示DNN在测试阶段能保持次优频谱效率，适应距离变化。

Conclusion: DNN在RIS辅助系统中具有潜力，可显著提升性能与效率。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种选择性特征重编码策略和并行模式QCNN架构，显著提升了量子卷积神经网络在图像分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用NISQ设备和量子原理（如纠缠和叠加）改进量子机器学习，特别是在图像分类任务中。

Method: 提出选择性特征重编码策略和并行模式QCNN架构，结合PCA和自动编码器的特征提取方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MNIST和Fashion MNIST数据集上显著提升了分类准确率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 选择性特征重编码和并行QCNN架构为量子机器学习提供了有效的改进方向。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.

### [186] [DecoRTL: A Run-time Decoding Framework for RTL Code Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02226)
*Mohammad Akyash,Kimia Azar,Hadi Kamali*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DecoRTL的新型解码策略，用于改进大型语言模型在RTL代码生成中的表现，解决了传统解码策略在结构和语义上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM解码策略在RTL代码生成中常导致无效或重复的输出，无法满足结构和语义需求。

Method: DecoRTL结合了自一致性采样和语法感知温度调整，生成并重新排名候选代码，同时根据语法角色调整采样温度。

Result: 在VerilogEval基准测试中，DecoRTL显著提高了语法有效性、功能正确性和输出多样性，且性能开销可忽略。

Conclusion: DecoRTL是一种无需额外微调的解码策略，有效提升了RTL代码生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently
shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation.
However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural
language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL,
leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we
first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an
empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings
reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or
semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to
differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)
and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical
regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time
decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code
generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)
self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks
them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining
diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies
tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling
temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens
and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at
inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we
demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional
correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance
overhead) is imperceptible.

Motivation: 研究算法配置与问题特征之间的相互作用，以提高算法性能的可解释性和配置选择的指导性。

Method: 计算六种CMA-ES变体在24个BBOB基准问题上的性能足迹，分析5维和30维设置下的表现。

Result: 发现不同配置因问题特征而表现各异，同时揭示了共性和差异性行为模式。

Conclusion: 算法足迹能有效提升算法性能的可解释性，并为配置选择提供指导。

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints
to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem
characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the
BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional.
These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same
algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features
influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns
across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in
enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

Result: 应用于十种数值元启发式算法，揭示了其稳定性和行为差异。

Conclusion: 新方法提供了对算法搜索动态的深入理解。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

TL;DR: DeSTA2.5-Audio是一种通用大型音频语言模型（LALM），通过自生成跨模态对齐策略避免任务特定调优，同时保持语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LALMs在增强音频能力时导致语言能力遗忘的问题。

Method: 提出DeSTA策略，利用主干LLM自生成训练目标，构建大规模任务无关数据集DeSTA-AQA5M。

Result: 在多个音频-语言基准测试中达到或超越最优性能。

Conclusion: 自生成数据策略在LALM开发中至关重要，为构建通用LALM提供实用见解。

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多代理并行处理听觉场景分析（ASA）的方法，通过任务间的反馈循环减少错误，降低响应时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性处理ASA任务导致高响应时间和误差累积，难以满足低计算资源需求的应用场景。

Method: 采用多代理并行处理，任务间引入反馈循环以纠正局部错误。

Result: 开发了MASA系统，具有低响应时间、抗局部错误能力，且计算复杂度可控。

Conclusion: MASA系统为ASA提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于多种实时应用。

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

Motivation: 解决动态场景中高计算资源需求的跟踪算法问题，以适应实时语音增强的应用需求。

Method: 采用粒子滤波作为低复杂度跟踪算法，并引入时空反馈机制，利用增强后的语音信号优化跟踪精度。

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了跟踪精度和增强性能的显著提升，实际录音的听测结果也优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自导向管道在动态场景中表现出色，是资源受限环境下实时语音增强的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning driven framework for sectoral stress
testing in the Indian financial market, focusing on financial services,
information technology, energy, consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals. Initially,
we address the limitations observed in conventional stress testing through
dimensionality reduction and latent factor modeling via Principal Component
Analysis and Autoencoders. Building on this, we extend the methodology using
Variational Autoencoders, which introduces a probabilistic structure to the
latent space. This enables Monte Carlo-based scenario generation, allowing for
more nuanced, distribution-aware simulation of stressed market conditions. The
proposed framework captures complex non-linear dependencies and supports risk
estimation through Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Together, these
pipelines demonstrate the potential of Machine Learning approaches to improve
the flexibility, robustness, and realism of financial stress testing.

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT框架显著提升了事件流场景文本识别的性能，并提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

Result: 提供了基线模型和CAR指标，为GA推荐和生成研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k推动了视觉科学传播的发展，并为AI在科学中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to

Conclusion: HIVE框架通过多模态叙事理解和场景级分割，有效提升了自动视频编辑的连贯性和质量，为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

### [197] [Visual Contextual Attack: Jailbreaking MLLMs with Image-Driven Context Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02844)
*Ziqi Miao,Yi Ding,Lijun Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型视觉中心越狱攻击（VisCo Attack），通过视觉信息构建完整的越狱场景，显著提升了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在现实应用中存在视觉模态的安全漏洞，现有方法缺乏现实场景的语义基础。

Method: VisCo Attack通过四种视觉策略构建上下文对话，动态生成辅助图像，并结合毒性模糊和语义优化生成攻击提示。

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上对GPT-4o的毒性得分为4.78，攻击成功率为85%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VisCo Attack为视觉中心越狱攻击提供了有效方法，揭示了MLLMs在开放环境中的安全风险。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The
code is available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Visco-Attack.

*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了在少量图像数据下如何利用扩散模型生成高质量的合成数据来提升物体检测器的性能，比较了基于提示和基于布局的两种条件策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业视觉系统中高质量训练数据收集耗时且困难，合成数据成为一种关键解决方案，但现有方法生成速度慢且与真实数据存在差距。扩散模型能快速生成高质量图像，但精确控制仍具挑战。

Method: 研究了80种视觉概念，比较了基于提示和基于布局的两种条件策略，分析了不同条件下合成数据的质量。

Result: 当条件线索匹配完整训练分布时，合成数据使平均精度提升34%，最高可达177%。

Conclusion: 布局条件策略在多样性高时表现更优，能显著提升物体检测性能。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgVisAgent是一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的智能手术视觉代理，能够动态识别内窥镜图像中的失真类别和严重程度，执行多种增强任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法通常针对单一任务设计，难以应对复杂手术场景的多样化需求。

Method: 通过设计先验模型提供领域知识，结合上下文少样本学习和链式推理（CoT），实现定制化图像增强。

Result: 在模拟真实手术失真的基准测试中，SurgVisAgent表现优于传统单任务模型。

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent有望成为手术辅助的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Motivation: 传统单标签分类方法无法捕捉飓风后损害的复杂性，需要更准确的评估方法以支持有效的灾害响应。

Method: 结合ResNet特征提取模块和类特定注意力机制，实现多标签分类。

Result: 在Rescuenet数据集上，平均精度达到90.23%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了飓风后损害评估的准确性和效率，有助于未来的灾害缓解和恢复策略。

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version
will appear in the official conference proceedings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自蒸馏方法，将视频到音频（V2A）生成模型扩展到电影语言场景，解决了部分可见目标性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前V2A方法忽视了电影语言这一艺术表达的关键部分，导致在部分可见目标场景中性能下降。

Method: 采用自蒸馏方法，通过模拟电影语言变化，使学生模型学习对齐视频特征与音频-视觉对应关系。

Result: 在部分可见场景中所有评估指标均有显著提升，同时在大规模V2A数据集VGGSound上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了V2A模型在电影语言场景中的性能，尤其在部分可见目标情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC是一种基于扩散模型的少样本异常生成方法，通过多级扰动和上下文感知对齐解决现有方法的不足，在MVTec-AD数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业质量控制中异常数据稀缺，现有方法无法同时满足背景保留、异常区域精确填充和语义合理性三个需求。

Method: MAGIC基于Stable Diffusion修复模型，结合高斯提示级扰动和空间噪声注入，并引入上下文感知对齐模块。

Result: 在MVTec-AD数据集上，MAGIC在下游异常任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC通过多级扰动和上下文对齐，解决了少样本异常生成中的关键问题，提升了生成质量和多样性。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于人工神经网络（ANN）的图像处理技术，用于水稻叶病的早期分类和识别，并通过对比特征分析检测模型（FADM）和直接图像中心检测模型（DICDM），验证了FADM的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻叶病严重影响产量和经济收益，早期检测对有效管理和提高产量至关重要。

Method: 研究采用特征提取算法（FEAs）、降维算法（DRAs）、特征选择算法（FSAs）和极限学习机（ELM）构建FADM，并与不依赖FEA的DICDM进行对比，使用10折交叉验证方法评估性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，FADM在分类水稻叶病方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: FADM在检测水稻叶病方面具有显著潜力，可改善作物健康、减少产量损失并提升水稻种植的可持续性。

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

Motivation: 准确检测CoW分叉处的标志点对快速高效诊断至关重要，但现有方法存在漏检和解剖变异问题。

Method: 采用两阶段神经网络：目标检测网络定位感兴趣区域（ROIs），改进的U-Net精确定位分叉点。

Result: 在两种MRA数据集上测试，该方法在分叉检测任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法有效解决了漏检和解剖变异问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

TL;DR: Hita是一种新型图像分词器，通过全局到局部的分词方案和关键策略改进自回归图像生成，显著提升训练速度和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自回归图像生成模型无法捕捉全局关系的问题，以及视觉分词器缺乏全局信息的局限性。

Method: 引入全局到局部的分词方案，结合可学习的全局查询和局部补丁标记，采用轻量级融合模块控制信息流。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中达到2.59 FID和281.9 IS，训练速度更快，并在零样本风格迁移和图像修复中表现优异。

Conclusion: Hita通过全局表示显著提升了自回归图像生成的性能，适用于多种图像任务。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Motivation: 传统检测器仅通过堆叠空间频率谱来表征时间信息，无法检测像素平面的时间伪影。

Method: 对每个像素的时间轴进行1D傅里叶变换，提取时间不一致性特征；引入注意力提议模块和联合Transformer模块。

Result: 显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的鲁棒性，适用于多样化和挑战性场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在检测深度伪造视频方面取得了重要进展。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Motivation: 机器人因摄像头低帧率和检测算法速度限制，导致任务执行时间增加。现有工具如Vitis-AI未能充分利用FPGA的PL部分。

Method: 使用FINN架构在FPGA的PL部分部署三种量化ANN模型（MobileNet v1 4-bit、CNV 2-bit和BNN 1-bit），并在RG2C数据集上训练。

Result: MobileNet v1表现最佳，成功率达98%，推理速度为6611 FPS。

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them

Conclusion: CrowdTrack数据集填补了现有不足，有望推动复杂场景下的多行人跟踪研究。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases
across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food
security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting
multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse

of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available
repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Result: 实验表明APT有效减少过拟合，保持先验知识，并在有限数据下生成高质量多样图像。

Conclusion: APT为有限数据下的扩散模型个性化提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本特征引导的视觉提示调优框架，结合语言模型和视觉提示，通过WERA增强域不变性，在多个DG数据集上表现优异。

Motivation: 解决域泛化中视觉提示调优难以解耦跨域不变特征的挑战，利用VFM的语言提示灵活性和可控性。

Method: 使用LLM自动解耦文本提示，引导学习域不变视觉表示；引入WERA通过抽象提示增强源域多样性。

Result: 在PACS、VLCS等主要DG数据集上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 文本引导的视觉提示调优结合WERA能有效提升域泛化性能。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Method: FairHuman通过构建全局目标和两个局部目标（基于预标注的位置先验），并采用最小潜在延迟（MPD）准则优化参数更新策略，实现多目标公平优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持整体质量的同时，显著提升了局部细节的生成效果。

Conclusion: FairHuman通过多目标优化策略，有效提升了人类图像生成的局部细节质量，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的二次复杂度在处理高分辨率输入时不切实际，现有方法常以丢失细节为代价。

Method: 受n体数值模拟启发，将注意力建模为网格点间的交互问题，提出MANO，实现线性复杂度。

Result: 在图像分类和Darcy流任务中，MANO性能媲美ViT和Swin Transformer，同时大幅降低运行时和内存占用。

Conclusion: MANO通过多尺度注意力机制，高效解决了Transformer的高复杂度问题，为高分辨率输入处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，但标注成本高。涂鸦标注是一种稀疏标注方式，但缺乏足够的特征学习和边界监督。

Method: TAB Net包含三重增强自恢复模块（TAS）和边界感知伪标签监督模块（BAP），分别通过增强特征学习和边界建模来提升分割效果。

Result: 在ACDC和MSCMR seg数据集上，TAB Net显著优于现有弱监督方法，性能接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: TAB Net为稀疏标注下的医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案，性能接近全监督方法。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Conclusion: USAD方法有效解决了HAR的关键问题，并在实际部署中验证了其高效性和可行性。

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to
simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible,
resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds
numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained
generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency
dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects
high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed
turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations
with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to
deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model
faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity
and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian
statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high
fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the
first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the
magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically
meaningful predictions.
