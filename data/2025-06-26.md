### [2] [Context Attribution with Multi-Armed Bandit Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19977)
*Deng Pan,Keerthiram Murugesan,Nuno Moniz,Nitesh Chawla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组合多臂老虎机（CMAB）的框架，用于高效探索上下文子集，以理解生成式QA系统中上下文对模型答案的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高生成式QA系统的可解释性和可信度，需要明确检索到的上下文中哪些部分对模型生成答案有贡献。

Method: 将上下文段视为老虎机臂，使用组合汤普森采样（CTS）在有限查询预算下高效探索上下文子集空间，定义基于归一化标记似然的奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少模型查询次数的同时，保持了较高的归因质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和归因质量上优于传统的扰动归因方法。

Abstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large
language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and
trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates
context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each
context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial
Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of
context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward
function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of
segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional
perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets
uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances
exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment
relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while
maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution
quality with fewer model queries.

remains underexplored. This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum
code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack).
We introduce QHackBench, a novel benchmark dataset derived from QHack
competitions, and evaluate model performance under vanilla prompting and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our structured evaluation framework

models, supplemented with an augmented PennyLane dataset, approximately
generate similar results as the standard prompting, particularly in complex
quantum algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation
pipeline that iteratively refines incorrect solutions, further enhancing
execution success rates. To foster further research, we commit to publicly
releasing QHackBench, along with our evaluation framework and experimental
results, enabling continued advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming.

### [4] [Accurate and Energy Efficient: Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation Models Outperform Commercial Large Language Models in Medical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20009)
*Konstantinos Vrettos,Michail E. Klontzas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个可定制的RAG框架用于医疗任务，其性能优于商业模型且能耗更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在医疗领域应用中的环境和伦理问题，如资源消耗和患者隐私。

Method: 开发了可监控能耗的RAG框架，并基于开源LLM构建RAG模型，与商业模型进行对比。

Result: 自定义RAG模型在准确性和能耗上均优于商业模型，llama3.1:8B表现最佳。

Conclusion: 本地LLM可用于开发高性能、低能耗的医疗RAG模型，符合可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical
implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems
for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and
safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2
emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various
open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like
llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs
performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs
o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.
Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy
consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy
(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and
DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption
and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a
total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x
times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while
maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs
can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in
medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular
framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and
aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

### [6] [Persona-Assigned Large Language Models Exhibit Human-Like Motivated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20020)
*Saloni Dash,Amélie Reymond,Emma S. Spiro,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在分配特定政治和社会人口角色后，会表现出类似人类的动机性推理，导致对信息的真实性辨别能力下降，且难以通过常规提示方法消除偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否会在分配角色后表现出动机性推理，从而影响其判断和决策能力，尤其是在政治和社会议题上。

Method: 通过为8种LLMs分配4种政治和社会人口角色，测试其在信息真实性辨别和科学证据评估任务中的表现。

Result: 角色分配的LLMs在信息真实性辨别能力上下降高达9%，政治角色在科学证据评估中更倾向于支持与其身份相符的结论。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出类似人类的动机性推理，且难以通过常规方法消除偏见，可能加剧身份认同驱动的推理问题。

Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like
identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This
motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when
debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,
and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported
that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive
biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward
identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate
whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic
attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and
proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity
discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific
evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity
discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas
specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific
evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced
political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at
mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first
to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning
that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising
concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.

### [7] [DiaLLMs: EHR Enhanced Clinical Conversational System for Clinical Test Recommendation and Diagnosis Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20059)
*Weijieying Ren,Tianxiang Zhao,Lei Wang,Tianchun Wang,Vasant Honavar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiaLLM是一种新型医疗大语言模型，整合电子健康记录（EHR）数据以支持临床测试推荐、结果解释和诊断预测，显著提升临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型忽视电子健康记录（EHR）的作用，且仅关注诊断推荐，限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出DiaLLM模型，通过临床测试参考（CTR）策略构建临床对话，并采用强化学习框架进行证据获取和自动诊断。

Result: 实验表明DiaLLM在临床测试推荐和诊断预测方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DiaLLM通过整合EHR数据和优化诊断流程，显著提升了医疗大语言模型的临床适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the
essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on
diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose
DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into
clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result
interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world
medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we
design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to
its corresponding description and classifies test results as "normal" or
"abnormal". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for
evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space,
we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a
class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms
baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.

### [8] [AI Copilots for Reproducibility in Science: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20130)
*Adrien Bibal,Steven N. Minton,Deborah Khider,Yolanda Gil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenPub是一个AI驱动的平台，通过模块化助手（如Reproducibility Copilot）支持开放科学任务，显著减少研究复现时间，并系统性检测复现障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放科学倡议旨在提高研究的透明度和可复现性，但独立复现研究成果仍具挑战性。

Method: OpenPub平台利用Reproducibility Copilot分析论文、代码和补充材料，生成结构化Jupyter Notebook和建议，以促进计算复现。

Result: 测试显示，OpenPub将复现时间从30多小时缩短至约1小时，并高覆盖率地复现图表和结果。

Conclusion: AI工具可有效减轻复现负担，促进更透明的科学交流，其模块化架构支持扩展至其他开放科学目标。

Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent,
accessible, and reusable, but ensuring that published findings can be
independently reproduced remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces
OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and
readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks.
In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes
manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter
Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote",
reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied
research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that
OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to
about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results
suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects
barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented
preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. These findings
suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of
reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable
scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a
foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives
beyond reproducibility.

### [9] [Language Modeling by Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20249)
*Junyan Cheng,Peter Clark,Kyle Richardson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 利用多智能体LLM方法Genesys，通过遗传编程框架发现新的语言模型架构，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以利用LLM模拟研究过程，发现新的语言模型架构。

Method: 采用多智能体LLM方法，结合比例法则和遗传编程，分阶段验证设计。

Result: 生成1,162个新设计，其中1,062个通过验证，部分性能优于GPT2和Mamba2。

Conclusion: Genesys系统在自主发现高效语言模型架构方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model
(LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM
approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and
literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation),
generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas
from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.

*Liya Wang,David Yi,Damien Jose,John Passarelli,James Gao,Jordan Leventis,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个基于Bloom分类法的14任务框架，用于全面评估大语言模型在企业环境中的能力，并开发了一个可扩展的标注和评估流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准（如MMLU）未能充分评估企业特定任务的复杂性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 结合LLM-as-a-Labeler、LLM-as-a-Judge和CRAG技术，构建了一个9,700样本的基准数据集。

Result: 开源模型（如DeepSeek R1）在推理任务中表现接近专有模型，但在判断任务中表现较差，可能因过度思考。

Conclusion: 该研究为企业提供了定制化评估的蓝图，并推动了大语言模型的实际部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) ) have demonstrated promise in boosting
productivity across AI-powered tools, yet existing benchmarks like Massive
Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) inadequately assess enterprise-specific
task complexities. We propose a 14-task framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy
to holistically evaluate LLM capabilities in enterprise contexts. To address
challenges of noisy data and costly annotation, we develop a scalable pipeline
combining LLM-as-a-Labeler, LLM-as-a-Judge, and corrective retrieval-augmented
generation (CRAG), curating a robust 9,700-sample benchmark. Evaluation of six
leading models shows open-source contenders like DeepSeek R1 rival proprietary
models in reasoning tasks but lag in judgment-based scenarios, likely due to
overthinking. Our benchmark reveals critical enterprise performance gaps and
offers actionable insights for model optimization. This work provides
enterprises a blueprint for tailored evaluations and advances practical LLM
deployment.

### [11] [Mobile-R1: Towards Interactive Reinforcement Learning for VLM-Based Mobile Agent via Task-Level Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20332)
*Jihao Gu,Qihang Ai,Yingyao Wang,Pi Bu,Jingxuan Xing,Zekun Zhu,Wei Jiang,Ziming Wang,Yingxiu Zhao,Ming-Liang Zhang,Jun Song,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Mobile-R1方法，通过任务级奖励的多轮交互强化学习提升移动代理的探索和纠错能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多基于离线强化学习或动作级奖励的在线优化，限制了代理与环境的动态交互，导致局部最优和探索能力不足。

Method: 采用三阶段训练框架：初始格式微调、动作级奖励的单步在线训练、任务级奖励的多轮轨迹在线训练。

Result: 显著提升了代理的性能，并发布了包含28个中文应用的数据集和500条轨迹的新基准。

Conclusion: Mobile-R1通过任务级奖励和多轮交互强化学习，有效增强了移动代理的探索和纠错能力。

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only
understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their
action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement
learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing
research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online
optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic
interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into
local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action
correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called
Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with
task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three
stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level
reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn
trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error
correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance
improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese
applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new
benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including
the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为REFeat的新方法，通过引导大型语言模型（LLM）利用多种推理类型生成多样且信息丰富的特征，解决了现有LLM方法在特征工程中生成简单或重复特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的特征生成方法存在生成特征过于简单或重复的问题，部分原因是LLM选择的转换存在固有偏见，且缺乏结构化推理指导。

Method: 提出REFeat方法，通过多种推理类型引导LLM生成多样且信息丰富的特征。

Result: 在59个基准数据集上的实验表明，REFeat不仅平均预测准确率更高，还能发现更多样且有意义的新特征。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将丰富的推理模式和自适应策略选择融入LLM驱动的特征发现中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step
in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or
repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the
LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover
diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to
steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on
average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results
highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive
strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.

in the document. We will introduce Paladin-mini, a compact (3.8B parameters)
open-source classifier model (used for labeling data as grounded or ungrounded)
engineered for robust performance in real-world scenarios, and the
grounding-benchmark, a new evaluation dataset designed to assess performance on
critical reasoning tasks. We'll also demonstrate the results of Paladin-mini
with benchmarks against the current State-of-the-art and share clear and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了EVOP-V2G问题，通过混合整数规划和元启发式算法优化电动车在V2G技术下的充电、放电和订单选择，显著提升司机利润。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动车普及和V2G技术的发展，如何在动态电价和路线约束下最大化电动车司机的利润成为关键问题。

Method: 采用混合整数规划（MIP）建模，并提出两种元启发式算法：进化算法（EA）和大邻域搜索（LNS）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实数据上可使司机利润翻倍，并在小规模实例中接近最优，大规模实例中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究为电动车智能调度和电网支持提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service
systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating
EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a
shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when
fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -
allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and
complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem
with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select
customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or
discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging
station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic
algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood
search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver
profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on
small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a
promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that
actively support the energy grid.

next, when to execute the task, and who to assign the task to. Suitable
software tools are required to support these decisions in a way that is optimal
for the organization. This paper presents a software library, called GymPN,
that supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep
Reinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task
assignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for
partial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a
business process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of
previous work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process
decisions. We evaluate the library on eight typical business process
decision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling
of the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.

*Salvatore Milite,Giulio Caravagna,Andrea Sottoriva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了混合神经细胞自动机（MNCA），通过结合概率规则和固有噪声，增强了对生物系统随机性的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经细胞自动机（NCA）的确定性限制了其对真实生物系统随机性的捕捉，需要一种新方法来模拟更复杂的动态行为。

Method: 将混合模型思想引入NCA框架，结合概率规则和固有噪声，形成MNCA。

Result: 在组织生长模拟、图像形态生成和显微镜图像分割中，MNCA表现出更强的鲁棒性、更真实的生物生长模式及可解释的规则分割。

Conclusion: MNCA是模拟随机动态系统和研究自生长过程的有力工具。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are a promising new approach to model
self-organizing processes, with potential applications in life science.
However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the
stochasticity of real-world biological and physical systems.
  We propose the Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), a novel framework
incorporating the idea of mixture models into the NCA paradigm. By combining
probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse
local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological
processes.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic
simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis
robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs
achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real
biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These
findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical
systems and studying self-growth processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为设计和构建具有感知能力的机器提供一个明确且可操作的定义。

Method: 提出感知需满足功能性和主观性，并通过具体信号（断言性和定性）实现。

Result: 提出了一个具体的感知定义，并探讨了当前技术下的潜在实现方法。

Conclusion: 明确AI感知的功能性定义有助于避免无意中创造具有感知能力的机器。

Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and
building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI,
it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to
allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect
something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to
encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to
occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric
(persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete
terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current
technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be
functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at
least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在自动驾驶中直接应用的局限性，如领域适应、上下文接地和缺乏经验知识，以实现可靠且可解释的决策。

Method: 提出CBR-LLM框架，整合语义场景理解和历史案例检索，利用风险感知提示策略和相似性案例检索优化决策。

Conclusion: CBR-LLM框架在复杂驾驶场景中展现出适应性强的决策支持潜力，为智能驾驶系统提供了可信赖的工具。

Abstract: Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware
decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential
reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose
reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making.
However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to
challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of
experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in
dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a
Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for
evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach
integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the
retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver
recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments
across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision
accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior.
Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk
types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random
sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the
framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its
potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent
driving systems.

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need
for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific
scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent
Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein
production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based
LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific
literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,
and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to
extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel
methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent
optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the
performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based
cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine
similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean
scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved
the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to
prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with
the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling
the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of
additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

Result: 初步构建了知识中心的AI框架，专注于可扩展Krylov求解器，提升了文档和开发支持。

Conclusion: 目标是扩展为强大的知识平台，加速科学发现，未来将进一步完善系统。

Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is
transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended.
PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific
computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three
decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists,
GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this
knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To
activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has
begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom
LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking
algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose
updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences
designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using
RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for
various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the
Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses
can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial
focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible
framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable
support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and
development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into
a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large language model-based machine learning (ML) agents have shown great
promise in automating ML research. However, existing agents typically operate
in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader

Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at
exchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context.
CoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2%
human competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions. Our code

TL;DR: 论文提出Decrypto，一个基于游戏的基准测试，用于评估LLMs在多智能体推理和心智理论（ToM）方面的能力，填补了现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs具备代理能力，需要理解其在多智能体场景中的交互能力，尤其是心智理论（ToM），但目前缺乏有效的评估工具。

Method: 设计Decrypto基准测试，结合认知科学、计算语用学和多智能体强化学习，简化其他维度以消除干扰因素。

Result: 前沿LLMs在游戏能力上落后于人类和简单词嵌入基线模型，且在经典认知科学实验变体中表现更差。

Conclusion: Decrypto填补了当前推理和ToM评估的空白，为开发更优的人工智能代理提供了路径。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to
navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other
agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning
skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason
about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent
abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from
narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus
propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM
drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and
multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in
all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other
benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing
interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations
of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We
find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple
word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive
science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.
Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly
worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that
Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and
paves the path towards better artificial agents.

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's
understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid
advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to
misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted
and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer
review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer
robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are
made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a
dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would
provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that
critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic
self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including
track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an
illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude
that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML
research self-correct.

Motivation: 多目标优化（MOO）在多个领域有广泛应用，但现有方法在收敛速度和样本复杂度上表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: STIMULUS通过递归框架更新随机梯度估计，提升收敛性能；STIMULUS-M加入动量项加速收敛；STIMULUS+/M+引入自适应批处理减少全梯度评估需求。

Conclusion: STIMULUS系列算法在多目标优化中表现出色，具有高效性和鲁棒性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recently, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has gained attention for its
broad applications in ML, operations research, and engineering. However, MOO
algorithm design remains in its infancy and many existing MOO methods suffer
from unsatisfactory convergence rate and sample complexity performance. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called STIMULUS(
stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive e\ulstimator), a new and
robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional
methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for
updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with
low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of
STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further
expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed
methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex
settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we
achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample
complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln
({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a
desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient
evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced
versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their
theoretical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Koopman理论的飞行轨迹预测模型效率低、可解释性差且计算量大，需改进。

Method: FlightKooba直接基于数据构建Koopman算子，减少可训练参数，优化训练时间和内存消耗。

Result: 实验显示FlightKooba在时间和内存消耗上表现优越（训练时间接近Mamba模块，内存减少50%以上，参数减少十倍）。

Conclusion: FlightKooba为Koopman算子的快速计算提供了新方法，拓展了时间序列预测与控制的结合可能性。

Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting
nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction
(FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the
Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is
indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive,
resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman
theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by
the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs
the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable
and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module,
thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the
superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory
consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using
CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with
a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the
FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman
operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series
forecasting and control.

Result: Hawkes过程模型在扫视建模上优于基线，但上下文惊奇度对注视持续时间的预测改进有限。

Conclusion: 惊奇度理论难以解释精细眼动行为，需进一步研究其他因素。

Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between
fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades
where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of
psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields
insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to
such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that
impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that
occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic
model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,
that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in
space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes
process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new
fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation
events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved
across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process
model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to
fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a
predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive
accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain
fine-grained eye movements.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了带宽、CPU频率和用户感知之间的因果关系，限制了QoE的提升。

Method: 提出PS-CDDPG算法，结合DDPG和因果推断，优化关键帧比率、带宽和计算资源。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著降低了交互延迟，提升了QoE，并保持了公平性。

Conclusion: 该框架在多用户VR交互中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality
(VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency,
high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While
adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing
approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,
CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an
intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe
extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE
metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual
sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.
The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming
(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational
resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By
leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by
various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal
inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments
conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework
significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains
fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from
pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR.
Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and
preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational
overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this
paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging
orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise
forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality
constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and
disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying
class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive
evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable
pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes,
and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership
inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient,
practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a
Service (MLaaS) scenarios.

edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.
Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by
transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent
representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on
the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that
possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless
transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this
paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm
for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the
cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and
used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel
conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge
distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,
an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge
distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression
rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment
between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.
Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the
baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.

*Antoine Pesenti,Aidan OSullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用深度神经网络（DNN）预测电价，并结合可解释人工智能（XAI）方法（如SHAP和Gradient）分析电价驱动因素，以增强对电力市场的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力市场高度复杂，传统计量经济学方法（白盒模型）在预测能力上不如DNN，但缺乏可解释性。本文旨在通过XAI方法揭示电价动态的驱动因素。

Method: 采用DNN预测电价，结合SHAP、Gradient等XAI方法及热图（显著性图）分析五个电力市场中各特征的行为和贡献，并提出SSHAP值和SSHAP线的新概念。

Result: 通过XAI方法成功识别了电价动态的关键驱动因素，并增强了高维表格模型的复杂表示能力。

Conclusion: DNN与XAI方法的结合不仅提高了电价预测的准确性，还提供了对电力市场运作机制的深入理解。

Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and
complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the
market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for
this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural
network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and
then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in
the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different
electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP
and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to
analyse the behaviour and contributions of various features across five
electricity markets. We introduce the novel concepts of SSHAP values and SSHAP
lines to enhance the complex representation of high-dimensional tabular models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于训练案例检索的后处理框架，通过测量神经网络决策的不确定性来检测和缓解错误，在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上验证了其优于基于softmax的置信度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在高风险领域（如医疗诊断或自动驾驶）中的错误决策可能带来严重后果，因此需要有效的不确定性测量方法来检测和缓解这些错误。

Method: 提出了一种后处理框架，通过检索与查询具有相似激活向量的训练案例，计算两个新指标：决策变化和层不确定性，以捕捉跨层最近邻类别分布的变化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST分类模型上的实验表明，所提指标显著提升了不确定性估计，尤其在具有挑战性的分类任务中优于基于softmax的置信度方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络决策的不确定性测量提供了有效工具，尤其适用于高风险领域，未来可进一步扩展至其他任务和数据集。

Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult
to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms
sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains
like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and
mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network
decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring
the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a
similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved
cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which
capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We
evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and
MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation,
especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based
confidence.

Motivation: 轴承故障可能导致严重运营中断和高维护成本，现有方法依赖大量标记数据且适应性不足。

Method: 使用深度Q网络（DQN）进行轴承故障分类任务，优化奖励结构以提升适应性。

Result: RL模型在受控条件下与传统方法性能相当，但在适应性上表现更优，计算需求较高。

Conclusion: RL有潜力补充传统方法，为自适应诊断框架铺平道路。

Abstract: Bearing faults in rotating machinery can lead to significant operational
disruptions and maintenance costs. Modern methods for bearing fault diagnosis
rely heavily on vibration analysis and machine learning techniques, which often
require extensive labeled data and may not adapt well to dynamic environments.
This study explores the feasibility of reinforcement learning (RL),
specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), for bearing fault classification tasks in
machine condition monitoring to enhance the accuracy and adaptability of
bearing fault diagnosis. The results demonstrate that while RL models developed
in this study can match the performance of traditional supervised learning
models under controlled conditions, they excel in adaptability when equipped
with optimized reward structures. However, their computational demands
highlight areas for further improvement. These findings demonstrate RL's
potential to complement traditional methods, paving the way for adaptive
diagnostic frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决比较AR与MDM范式时因架构差异导致的不公平问题，同时探索架构对MDM性能的影响。

Method: 方法包括将MDM作为任意顺序自回归（AO-AR）在仅解码器框架中评估，并分析不同架构（仅解码器vs仅编码器）对MDM的影响。

Result: 结果表明，仅解码器MDM在生成速度上显著提升（约25倍），且困惑度与仅编码器MDM相当，但建模空间更大。

Conclusion: 结论指出，该研究解耦了范式与架构的影响，为未来模型设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的方法来评估特征组在广义加性模型（GAMs）中的重要性，无需重新训练模型，支持事后定义组和重叠组，并在高维数据中保持有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可解释机器学习中，特征组的重要性常被忽视，而联合信号可能提供关键洞察。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的方法来确定特征组的重要性，适用于GAMs，具有高效性和灵活性。

Result: 通过合成实验和两个实际案例（抑郁症症状识别和健康社会决定因素研究）验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 分析特征组的重要性比单一特征分析更全面，尤其在医学领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: While analyzing the importance of features has become ubiquitous in
interpretable machine learning, the joint signal from a group of related
features is sometimes overlooked or inadvertently excluded. Neglecting the
joint signal could bypass a critical insight: in many instances, the most
significant predictors are not isolated features, but rather the combined
effect of groups of features. This can be especially problematic for datasets
that contain natural groupings of features, including multimodal datasets. This
paper introduces a novel approach to determine the importance of a group of
features for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) that is efficient, requires no
model retraining, allows defining groups posthoc, permits overlapping groups,
and remains meaningful in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, this definition
offers a parallel with explained variation in statistics. We showcase
properties of our method on three synthetic experiments that illustrate the
behavior of group importance across various data regimes. We then demonstrate
the importance of groups of features in identifying depressive symptoms from a
multimodal neuroscience dataset, and study the importance of social
determinants of health after total hip arthroplasty. These two case studies
reveal that analyzing group importance offers a more accurate, holistic view of
the medical issues compared to a single-feature analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 复杂数据集的快速增长需要既能有效分组又能提供人类可理解洞察的分析工具。

Result: 算法能够从复杂数据集中提取有意义的分层知识，并通过交互式可视化工具增强分析。

Conclusion: HERCULES在提升聚类结果的可解释性和实用性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities
necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but
also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We
introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using
LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package
designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including
text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES
constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering,
starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich
titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy,
significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main
representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data
embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters
based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a
`topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An
interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding
of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss
its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex
datasets.

Method: 引入转移预测误差作为遗憾近似的附加项，并提出共学习性度量任务间影响，结合二者形成TRACED方法。

Result: TRACED在多个基准测试中提升零样本泛化能力，且环境交互需求减少至基线的一半。

Conclusion: 通过精细的遗憾近似和任务关系建模，TRACED实现了高效的课程设计。

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments
remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised
Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher
adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns
a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically
measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current
performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these
approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term
in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects
performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called
co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware
Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED).
Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot
generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer
environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that
co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition
prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation
and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for
sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统漏电积分-发放（LIF）神经元无法有效捕捉边缘应用（如无线传感和音频识别）中的频谱特征，因此需要一种更高效的神经元模型。

Method: 采用具有振荡动态的RF神经元直接处理时域信号，通过可调谐频率共振提取时域局部频谱特征，同时保持低发放率。

Result: 在音频分类和调制分类任务中，RF-SNN架构的精度与LIF-SNN和ANN相当，但显著降低了发放率和总能耗。

Conclusion: RF-SNN架构为实时时间序列处理提供了一种高效且节能的解决方案。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many
edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate
streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured
by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper
investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs
resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain
signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By
resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral
features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity
translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission
energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike
transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance
on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental
results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy
to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and
total energy consumption during inference and communication.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应的微调和可学习的优化步骤，有效解决了传统量子联邦学习的局限性，适用于复杂应用场景。

Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a
new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously
optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors,
based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates
overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous
environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework
achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through
real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By
developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly
effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer
detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within
quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable
optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains
the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of
conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such
as healthcare and genomic research.

Conclusion: DIM-SUM为时间序列插补提供了一种高效、鲁棒的预处理框架，适用于现实世界中的复杂缺失模式。

Abstract: Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using
complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values.
However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter
datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex,
heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for
training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially
masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern
clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees
to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through
extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water
districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM
outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower
processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a
large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly
less inference time.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在高维混沌系统中难以建模复杂时间依赖性，且未明确处理不确定性增长问题。

Method: 通过调整EDM的核心组件（噪声调度、网络预处理和Heun采样器）以适应滚动预测，并提出新的损失加权方案、高效初始化策略和混合序列架构。

Conclusion: ERDM为处理扩散基序列生成问题提供了一个灵活且强大的框架，尤其适用于不确定性逐渐增加的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most
applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots
one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal
dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of
uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which
apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to
address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion
techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by
introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to
successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant
design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM
components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the
rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three
key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model
capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to
stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained
EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture
for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D
Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ
resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,
including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful
general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems
where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount. Code is available at:

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决机器学习模型在规模扩大时，如何通过损失加权克服训练数据引入的偏差，尤其是在中间参数化区间（介于欠参数化和过参数化之间）的效果。

Method: 方法聚焦于最后一层重新训练（LLR），分析损失加权在此区间的作用，并理论结合实践验证其有效性。

Result: 结果表明，损失加权在此区间仍然有效，但必须考虑模型的相对过参数化。

Conclusion: 结论指出，损失加权在中间参数化区间是可行的，但需根据模型的过参数化程度调整权重。

Abstract: While machine learning models become more capable in discriminative tasks at
scale, their ability to overcome biases introduced by training data has come
under increasing scrutiny. Previous results suggest that there are two extremes
of parameterization with very different behaviors: the population
(underparameterized) setting where loss weighting is optimal and the separable
overparameterized setting where loss weighting is ineffective at ensuring equal
performance across classes. This work explores the regime of last layer
retraining (LLR) in which the unseen limited (retraining) data is frequently
inseparable and the model proportionately sized, falling between the two
aforementioned extremes. We show, in theory and practice, that loss weighting
is still effective in this regime, but that these weights \emph{must} take into
account the relative overparameterization of the model.

Motivation: 在灾难响应、搜索救援和军事任务中，多智能体操作需要自动化规划支持，同时环境变化和智能体能力差异增加了规划的复杂性。因此，需要生成多样化的COA池以提高适应性。

Method: 通过图抽象表示任务空间和COA池，使用遗传算法最大化COA池的多样性和智能体-任务兼容性，并结合图神经网络进行单智能体任务排序。

Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that
involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of
the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the
environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance
of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task
distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which
could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities
and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new
theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse
pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility.
Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the
pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a
centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used
for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize
diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task
mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to
then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes
completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation
process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain
over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and
execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task
operations.

Abstract: Machine learning providers commonly distribute global models to edge devices,
which subsequently personalize these models using local data. However, issues
such as copyright infringements, biases, or regulatory requirements may require
the verifiable removal of certain data samples across all edge devices.
Ensuring that edge devices correctly execute such unlearning operations is
critical to maintaining integrity.
  In this work, we introduce a verification framework leveraging zero-knowledge
proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs, to confirm data unlearning on personalized
edge-device models without compromising privacy. We have developed algorithms
explicitly designed to facilitate unlearning operations that are compatible
with efficient zk-SNARK proof generation, ensuring minimal computational and
memory overhead suitable for constrained edge environments. Furthermore, our
approach carefully preserves personalized enhancements on edge devices,
maintaining model performance post-unlearning.
  Our results affirm the practicality and effectiveness of this verification
framework, demonstrating verifiable unlearning with minimal degradation in
personalization-induced performance improvements. Our methodology ensures
verifiable, privacy-preserving, and effective machine unlearning across edge
devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLVQVAE的框架，通过向量量化技术跨层映射神经网络表示，将冗余特征压缩为紧凑、可解释的概念向量，解决了现有方法忽略跨层叠加和冗余的问题。


<details>

Result: 提出的框架能够有效压缩冗余特征，生成可解释的概念向量。

Conclusion: CLVQVAE框架为跨层特征提取提供了新方法，有助于理解大型语言模型中的特征演变。

Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant
challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates
information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models.
Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single
layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy
it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for
activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited
set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose
\gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations
across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features
into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines
top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook
updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while
maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with
scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by
directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic
structure in word embedding space.

*Soheil Abadifard,Fazli Can*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合局部敏感哈希与随机超平面投影（LSH-RHP）的动态集成多样化（DynED）框架，用于处理多类不平衡数据流分类问题，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类不平衡数据流的分类问题在机器学习中具有挑战性，尤其是动态不平衡比的管理。现有研究主要集中在二分类问题，多类问题的解决方案较少。

Method: 提出LSH-DynED方法，利用LSH-RHP对多数类进行欠采样，生成平衡训练集，并提升集成模型的预测性能。

Result: 在23个真实世界和10个半合成数据集上的实验表明，LSH-DynED在Kappa和mG-Mean指标上优于15种现有方法，尤其适用于大规模、高维数据。

Conclusion: LSH-DynED在处理多类不平衡非平稳数据流时表现出色，具有适应性和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class
distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing
with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks
have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on
multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance
ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust,
and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality
Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic
Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we
present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of
imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the
majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and
improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare
LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED
outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness
measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced
non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale,
high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates
adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design,
we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges,
and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we
have made our implementation available on GitHub.

Motivation: 在临床环境中，量化GNN的预测不确定性对可信度至关重要，但现有方法（如贝叶斯和集成方法）计算成本高且无法充分捕捉模型多样性。

Method: 采用自蒸馏技术，同一网络同时作为教师和学生模型，避免独立训练多个网络，并开发了一种新的不确定性度量方法，为每个GNN分类器分配不同权重。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV和Enzymes数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效捕捉预测不确定性，性能与MC Dropout和集成方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和精度上优于传统方法，适用于临床环境中的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the
healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the
predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness
in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to
quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the
disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot
capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs'
uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply
self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and
student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks
independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an
uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning
different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the
precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing
out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture
the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to
that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: We investigate the use of randomly generated data for the sake of
pre-training a model. We justify this approach theoretically from the
perspective of algorithmic complexity, building on recent research that shows
that sequence models can be trained to approximate Solomonoff induction. We
derive similar, but complementary theoretical results. We show empirically that
synthetically generated data can be used to pre-train a model before the data
is seen. We replicate earlier results that models trained this way show
zero-shot in-context learning across a variety of datasets, and that this
performance improves with scale. We extend earlier results to real-world data,
and show that finetuning a model after pre-training offers faster convergence
and better generalization.

Abstract: Developing effective instruction-following policies in reinforcement learning
remains challenging due to the reliance on extensive human-labeled instruction
datasets and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate open-ended instructions retrospectively
from previously collected agent trajectories. Our core idea is to employ LLMs
to relabel unsuccessful trajectories by identifying meaningful subtasks the
agent has implicitly accomplished, thereby enriching the agent's training data
and substantially alleviating reliance on human annotations. Through this
open-ended instruction relabeling, we efficiently learn a unified
instruction-following policy capable of handling diverse tasks within a single
policy. We empirically evaluate our proposed method in the challenging Craftax
environment, demonstrating clear improvements in sample efficiency, instruction
coverage, and overall policy performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of utilizing LLM-guided
open-ended instruction relabeling to enhance instruction-following
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型监督耦合矩阵-张量分解方法（SCMTF），用于整合患者报告结果（PROs）和其他数据，预测溃疡性结肠炎（UC）的药物持续性。该方法首次在UC领域和PRO数据中应用，并成功处理了高缺失数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者报告的症状（PROs）通常噪声大、主观性强且稀疏，常被排除在机器学习方法之外。本文旨在探索如何利用PROs进行表型分析，以预测UC的药物持续性。

Method: 采用监督耦合矩阵-张量分解（SCMTF）方法，整合时间序列PROs、实验室数据和静态特征，结合深度学习框架，处理高缺失数据。

Result: 最佳模型在测试集上预测8个月和20个月后的药物变化，AUC分别为0.853和0.803，并提取了可解释的表型。

Conclusion: 低秩矩阵和张量分解方法可成功应用于UC领域和高缺失PRO数据，证明PROs包含通常被忽略的相关信息。

Abstract: Phenotyping is the process of distinguishing groups of patients to identify
different types of disease progression. A recent trend employs low-rank matrix
and tensor factorization methods for their capability of dealing with
multi-modal, heterogeneous, and missing data. Symptom quantification is crucial
for understanding patient experiences in inflammatory bowel disease, especially
in conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, patient-reported
symptoms are typically noisy, subjective, and significantly more sparse than
other data types. For this reason, they are usually not included in phenotyping
and other machine learning methods. This paper explores the application of
computational phenotyping to leverage Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a
novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method, which
integrates temporal PROs and temporal labs with static features to predict
medication persistence in ulcerative colitis. This is the first tensor-based
method that is both supervised and coupled, it is the first application to the
UC domain, and the first application to PROs. We use a deep learning framework
that makes the model flexible and easy to train. The proposed method allows us
to handle the large amount of missing data in the PROs. The best model predicts
changes in medication 8 and 20 months in the future with AUCs of 0.853 and
0.803 on the test set respectively. We derive interpretable phenotypes
consisting of static features and temporal features (including their temporal
patterns). We show that low-rank matrix and tensor based phenotyping can be
successfully applied to the UC domain and to highly missing PRO data. We
identify phenotypes useful to predict medication persistence - these phenotypes
include several symptom variables, showing that PROs contain relevant
infromation that is usually discarded.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性维护对工业实践至关重要，但目前缺乏回归与分类方法的独立比较研究。

Method: 通过分析近期文献，比较回归（估计剩余使用寿命）和分类（预测故障概率）方法。

Result: 回归方法提供剩余使用寿命估计，分类方法预测故障概率；两者各有优劣。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者和从业者提供了PdM方法的比较，并指出了未来研究方向，如混合方法和AI支持的系统。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a crucial element of modern
industrial practice. PdM plays a significant role in operational dependability
and cost management by decreasing unforeseen downtime and optimizing asset life
cycle management. Machine learning and deep learning have enabled more precise
forecasts of equipment failure and remaining useful life (RUL). Although many
studies have been conducted on PdM, there has not yet been a standalone
comparative study between regression- and classification-based approaches. In
this review, we look across a range of PdM methodologies, while focusing more
strongly on the comparative use of classification and regression methods in
prognostics. While regression-based methods typically provide estimates of RUL,
classification-based methods present a forecast of the probability of failure
across defined time intervals. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent
literature, we highlight key advancements, challenges-such as data imbalance
and high-dimensional feature spaces-and emerging trends, including hybrid
approaches and AI-enabled prognostic systems. This review aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with an awareness of the strengths and
compromises of various PdM methods and to help identify future research and
build more robust, directed adaptive maintenance systems. Future work may
include a systematic review of practical aspects such as public datasets,
benchmarking platforms, and open-source tools to support the advancement of PdM
research.

Method: 提出多级集成学习（MEL），训练多个轻量级备份模型，通过多目标优化鼓励模型多样性，确保独立或协作时性能良好。

Result: 实验表明，MEL在视觉、语言和音频数据集上表现接近原模型，故障时仍保持95.6%的集成精度。

Conclusion: MEL为边缘推理提供了高效、灵活的容错解决方案，显著提升了边缘服务的可靠性。

Abstract: AI inference at the edge is becoming increasingly common for low-latency
services. However, edge environments are power- and resource-constrained, and
susceptible to failures. Conventional failure resilience approaches, such as
cloud failover or compressed backups, often compromise latency or accuracy,
limiting their effectiveness for critical edge inference services. In this
paper, we propose Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL), a new framework for
resilient edge inference that simultaneously trains multiple lightweight backup
models capable of operating collaboratively, refining each other when multiple
servers are available, and independently under failures while maintaining good
accuracy. Specifically, we formulate our approach as a multi-objective
optimization problem with a loss formulation that inherently encourages
diversity among individual models to promote mutually refining representations,
while ensuring each model maintains good standalone performance. Empirical
evaluations across vision, language, and audio datasets show that MEL provides
performance comparable to original architectures while also providing fault
tolerance and deployment flexibility across edge platforms. Our results show
that our ensemble model, sized at 40\% of the original model, achieves similar
performance, while preserving 95.6\% of ensemble accuracy in the case of
failures when trained using MEL.

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity and severity at an alarming rate.
Recent advances in AI and publicly available satellite data enable monitoring
critical wildfire risk factors globally, at high resolution and low latency.
Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical wildfire risk factor and is
valuable for both wildfire research and operational response. However,
ground-based LFMC samples are both labor intensive and costly to acquire,
resulting in sparse and infrequent updates. In this work, we explore the use of
a pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model for generating
large-scale spatially complete (wall-to-wall) LFMC maps. Our approach achieves
significant improvements over previous methods using randomly initialized
models (20 reduction in RMSE). We provide an automated pipeline that enables
rapid generation of these LFMC maps across the United States, and demonstrate
its effectiveness in two regions recently impacted by wildfire (Eaton and
Palisades).

Motivation: 在确定性LTI系统中发现纯因果或驱动变量对数据驱动的因果网络重建至关重要，但现有方法无法处理带有代数关系的动态系统。

Method: PoV方法通过动态迭代PCA（DIPCA）确定代数关系数（$n_a$）、动态关系数（$n_d$）和约束矩阵，并通过条件数识别最小因果驱动子集。

Result: PoV方法在LTI-DAE系统中有效识别因果驱动变量，适用于纯动态系统。

Conclusion: PoV方法优于现有方法，能够处理更广泛的动态系统，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is
of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A
recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal
discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are
identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical
systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method
works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations.
However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are
coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or
mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables
(PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is
superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as
PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic
equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal
subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations
($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix.
Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of
the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We develop a principled framework for discovering causal structure in partial
differential equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks and
counterfactual perturbations. Unlike classical residual minimization or sparse
regression methods, our approach quantifies operator-level necessity through
functional interventions on the governing dynamics. We introduce causal
sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics to assess the influence of
candidate differential operators within neural surrogates. Theoretically, we
prove exact recovery of the causal operator support under restricted isometry
or mutual coherence conditions, with residual bounds guaranteeing
identifiability. Empirically, we validate the framework on both synthetic and
real-world datasets across climate dynamics, tumor diffusion, and ocean flows.
Our method consistently recovers governing operators even under noise,
redundancy, and data scarcity, outperforming standard PINNs and DeepONets in
structural fidelity. This work positions causal PDE discovery as a tractable
and interpretable inference task grounded in structural causal models and
variational residual analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）部署成本高，现有剪枝方法未充分利用运行时激活稀疏性。

Method: 将激活稀疏性重新解释为动态结构化权重稀疏性，结合非结构化权重剪枝和激活稀疏性构建双稀疏（spMspV）工作负载，并扩展OBC框架以保留准确性。

Result: 在LLaMA-2和LLaMA-3上，DuoGPT在相同加速比下比基线密集模型准确率提升高达9.17%。

Conclusion: DuoGPT通过动态稀疏性和高效GPU执行优化，为LLMs的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but are difficult to
deploy due to high memory and compute costs. While pruning reduces these
demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We
reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and
propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV)
workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To
preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with
activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense
model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU
execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on
LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured
pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$
compared to the baseline dense model.

Result: 实验表明，Anubis在区分DeepSeek-Coder、CodeGemma和Stable-Code等LLM时，仅需约2000样本即可达到高AUROC分数（≥0.9）。

Conclusion: Anubis为代码归属提供了一种高效且可靠的方法，解决了高维数据下的归属难题。

Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs).
We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models
using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees.
Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to
assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse
of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are
given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the
LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames
attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark
of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores (
$\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and
Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.

Motivation: 情感计算中启动效应的模糊性是一个重要挑战，尤其是在生理信号数据中，启动效应对数据本身的影响尚未充分研究，可能导致模型分类错误。

Method: 提出APS方法，为每个数据点分配一个分数，量化其受启动效应影响的程度。在SEED和SEED-VII数据集上验证该方法，比较使用原始数据和去启动效应数据训练模型的分类错误率。

Result: 使用去启动效应数据训练的模型，其分类错误率显著低于使用原始数据的模型。

Conclusion: APS方法能有效识别和减轻数据层面的启动效应，增强模型鲁棒性，并为情感计算数据集的设计和收集提供重要见解。

Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective
computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a
label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by
the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in
physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead
to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the
Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points
influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,
quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this
method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient
transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train
models with the same configuration using both the original data and
priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced
when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work
contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating
priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering
valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing
datasets.

Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical
applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches
typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate
neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with
community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features
can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such
features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs
into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate
more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data,
respectively.

Conclusion: FedBKD框架能同时提升全局和局部模型的性能，且无需依赖公共数据集，有效保护数据隐私。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and
significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.
However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization
methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of
LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and
effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety
evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse
calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address
the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety
patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of
quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the
safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under
challenging evaluation scenarios. Project page is available at:

Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value
chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of
generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual
consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of
individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods
for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption
long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range
of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid
planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple
state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial
normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate
the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions
characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative
evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and
MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and
other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to
enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while
generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy
concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study
utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time
resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in
applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“recourse-aware ensembling (RAE)”的方法，用于解决在模型多重性（MM）下提供反事实解释（CEs）的鲁棒性问题。通过计算论证方法，该方法确保CEs在多模型下的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，模型多重性（MM）导致不同模型对同一输入的预测结果不同，这使得反事实解释（CEs）在多模型下可能不鲁棒。因此，需要一种方法在聚合预测和反事实解释时同时考虑两者的有效性。

Method: 提出了一种基于计算论证的RAE方法，通过显式表示模型与反事实解释之间的冲突，并利用论证语义解决冲突，确保CEs在多模型下的鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析表明，该方法在四种不同论证语义下表现良好。实证研究验证了该方法在满足六项理想性质方面的有效性。

Conclusion: RAE方法通过计算论证有效解决了在MM下提供鲁棒CEs的问题，并允许用户对模型进行偏好定制。

Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing
models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with
different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises
when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for
which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.
Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under
MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,
the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of
providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We
propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be
considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and
recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six
desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose
a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs
under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to
explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding
prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to
resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is
parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the
specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further
customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we
characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different
argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of
our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了集群间的共享信息，这些信息对所有联邦学习参与者具有通用价值。本文旨在通过蒸馏通用专家模型来弥补这一不足。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种场景下表现优异，能更灵活处理模型异质性并减少集群专家间的冲突。

Conclusion: 该方法通过平衡个性化和共享知识，推动了集群联邦学习的进展。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) addresses the challenges posed by non-IID
data by training multiple group- or cluster-specific expert models. However,
existing methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which
represents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the
Federated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the
knowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared
information across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client
as the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL
framework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each
client, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert
distillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of
fine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared
knowledge across clusters. Compared to traditional gradient-based aggregation
methods, the distillation-based model aggregation introduces greater
flexibility in handling model heterogeneity and reduces conflicts among
cluster-specific experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method across various scenarios,
highlighting its potential to advance the state of CFL by balancing
personalized and shared knowledge more effectively.

Motivation: 探索中等敏感度函数的学习，填补QR码解码领域的学习空白。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行QR码解码实验，分析其学习机制。

Result: Transformer能解码超出理论纠错限制的QR码，且能泛化到其他语言和随机字符串。

Conclusion: Transformer的QR解码机制与传统解码器不同，专注于数据位而非纠错位。

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

Motivation: 模仿学习在有限演示下难以准确学习专家策略，且需探索环境以实现超越专家性能。

Method: ILDE算法结合乐观策略优化（奖励高不确定性状态-动作对）和好奇心驱动探索（偏离演示轨迹的状态）。

Result: ILDE在Atari和MuJoCo任务中样本效率优于现有算法，且用更少演示实现超越专家性能。

Conclusion: ILDE通过不确定性正则化策略优化和乐观探索，实现了次线性增长的遗憾。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the
goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is
often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of
demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover,
it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve
beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration
(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy
optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high
uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and
(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the
demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.
Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art
imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves
beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations
than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as
an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic
exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

Conclusion: 置换等变神经图CDEs在减少参数的同时保持了表现力，提升了效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the interplay between
evolving node features and changing network structures. Recently, Graph Neural
Controlled Differential Equations (Graph Neural CDEs) successfully adapted
Neural CDEs from paths on Euclidean domains to paths on graph domains. Building
on this foundation, we introduce Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs,
which project Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces.
This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising
representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved
generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach
through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks,
showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器学习模型记忆训练数据的机制，指出仅依赖自影响（self-influence）会低估记忆风险，提出通过完整影响分布（influence distribution）更全面评估记忆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注自影响作为记忆指标，但忽略了其他训练样本（尤其是近重复样本）对记忆的影响，可能导致低估隐私和泛化风险。

Method: 通过计算训练样本间的完整影响分布，分析其对记忆的贡献，并在小语言模型和CIFAR-10图像分类任务中验证。

Result: 发现自影响会严重低估记忆风险，近重复样本虽降低自影响但仍可被提取；影响分布能揭示近重复样本的存在。

Conclusion: 记忆是训练数据间复杂交互的结果，完整影响分布比自影响更能准确捕捉记忆现象。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training
data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual
self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the
model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in
the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be
affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in
particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization
treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into
account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a
small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training
samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking
at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with
memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces
self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We
observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the
influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.
Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across
training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by
self-influence alone.

Conclusion: 研究为顺序捆绑推荐中的公平性问题提供了有效解决方案，并展示了不同方法的优缺点。

Abstract: We address fairness in the context of sequential bundle recommendation, where
users are served in turn with sets of relevant and compatible items. Motivated
by real-world scenarios, we formalize producer-fairness, that seeks to achieve
desired exposure of different item groups across users in a recommendation
session. Our formulation combines naturally with building high quality bundles.
Our problem is solved in real time as users arrive. We propose an exact
solution that caters to small instances of our problem. We then examine two
heuristics, quality-first and fairness-first, and an adaptive variant that
determines on-the-fly the right balance between bundle fairness and quality.
Our experiments on three real-world datasets underscore the strengths and
limitations of each solution and demonstrate their efficacy in providing fair
bundle recommendations without compromising bundle quality.

Method: 提出一种简单的离策略REINFORCE算法，其中优势定义为A=r-V，并通过调整基线V来优化算法表现。

Result: 理论分析表明，当基线V低于预期奖励时，算法具有策略改进保证。实验验证了在随机多臂老虎机任务和LLM推理任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 离策略更新更应关注正向奖励信号，而非负向信号，这一发现为优化离策略RL算法提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language
models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and
data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal
performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms
between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple
off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with
$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$
emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more
heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE
algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,
the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that
while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,
off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on
negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled
stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on
reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 传统线性VAR模型在GC分析中受限，现有DNN方法将GC视为变量选择问题，而本文认为GC与预测本质相关，提出通过深度学习联合建模时间序列来学习GC结构。

Method: 利用深度神经网络联合建模时间序列，通过比较模型在包含或排除特定时间序列时的残差分布或不确定性来揭示GC结构，并研究输入层dropout的影响。

Result: 研究表明，经过良好正则化的模型能够从数据中学习真实的GC结构，无需在损失函数中显式添加变量选择或稀疏回归项。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型可以通过联合建模时间序列和正则化技术有效学习GC结构，为GC分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the
association between multivariate time series data. Linear Vector Autoregressive
models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited
practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations
that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made
in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however
treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for
approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with
prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series
collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger
causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We
propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty
or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as
compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the
model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a
neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well
regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without
explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select
variables or perform sparse regression.

Motivation: 现有LoRA适配器放置策略缺乏明确指导，不同研究结果不一致，需要一种自动化的方法来优化适配器放置。

Method: 通过直观的理论分析，提出PLoP方法，自动识别预训练模型和微调任务中适合放置LoRA适配器的模块类型。

Result: PLoP在监督微调和强化学习推理任务中表现优于或与常用放置策略相当。

Conclusion: PLoP提供了一种高效且自动化的LoRA适配器放置策略，显著提升了模型微调的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large
models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models
to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different
modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example,
setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another
improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners
usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules.
Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive
results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules,
while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an
intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a
lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where
LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task.
We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case
competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive
experiments on supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算需求和部署成本不断增加，现有SVD压缩方法忽视矩阵关键组件的保护，导致压缩模型性能下降。

Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large

quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware
compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods
focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices
while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix,
which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper
proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based
compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most
critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted
data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important
layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a
heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of
compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD
outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple
benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model
compression ratios.

Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel
configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs),
particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography
(iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we
introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention
mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling
flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with
varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a
generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the
evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future
effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly
available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings
from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong
generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in
seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on
our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard
time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds
existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as
a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and
MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation
model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分类的特征选择方法，用于解决轨迹分析中的高维特征爆炸问题，提高模型效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹分析中高维特征导致的数据效率和可解释性下降问题，亟需一种有效的特征选择方法。

Method: 采用基于分类的特征选择方法，将特征分为几何和运动学两类，并进一步细分为曲率、凹陷、速度和加速度。

Result: 分类方法在预测性能上表现优异，显著减少了特征选择时间，并提供了对数据集敏感性的洞察。

Conclusion: 基于分类的特征选择方法能降低维度、提高可解释性，为轨迹数据集研究提供了方法论框架。

Abstract: Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also
of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves
through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the
significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially,
resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and
predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced
feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of
the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome
this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus,
the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection
method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This
approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further
categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The
comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently
achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the
taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select
features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights
into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study
provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add
a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational
complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step
toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners
dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of
explainable artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: LaplaceGNN为高效学习表达性图表征提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present LaplaceGNN, a novel self-supervised graph learning framework that
bypasses the need for negative sampling by leveraging spectral bootstrapping
techniques. Our method integrates Laplacian-based signals into the learning
process, allowing the model to effectively capture rich structural
representations without relying on contrastive objectives or handcrafted
augmentations. By focusing on positive alignment, LaplaceGNN achieves linear
scaling while offering a simpler, more efficient, self-supervised alternative
for graph neural networks, applicable across diverse domains. Our contributions
are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min
centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without
relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial
bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and
robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that
LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently
learning expressive graph representations.

novel Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) that uses Self-Supervised Learning

spectral bands) to create representations that are then fused using a
multilayer perceptron (MLP), resulting in a global representation map covering
the years 2017 to 2024. Our precomputed representations set a new
state-of-the-art performance benchmark and our open-source approach
democratizes access to high-performance, high-resolution representations. We
benchmark the performance of TESSERA in five diverse tasks, comparing our work
with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models. Our
results show that TESSERA outperforms both traditional RS baselines and the
leading geospatial foundation models in these diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: P4为资源受限设备提供了一种高效、隐私保护且鲁棒的个性化学习解决方案。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods
that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous,
resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning
in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient
knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience
against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by
developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to
deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring
differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution
employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client
similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage
differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models,
maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of
malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both
linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and
attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher
accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and
maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we
demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices,
where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of
overhead.

Motivation: 在非平稳环境中（如电子商务推荐），现有方法因假设平稳性或依赖限制性奖励建模假设而产生显著偏差，无法准确估计未来策略价值。

Method: 提出OPFV估计器，利用时间序列数据中的结构信息（如季节性、周效应等），通过新型重要性加权实现有效的未来策略评估。

Result: 理论分析表明OPFV在特定条件下具有低偏差，实验结果显示其在非平稳环境中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OPFV为未来策略评估和学习提供了高效工具，尤其在非平稳环境中表现突出。

Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and
learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in
non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce
recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the
policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in
the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future
environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume
stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to
significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator
named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture
\textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating
policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability
to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data
might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example,
seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical
and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related
structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE.
Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes
low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient
method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data.
Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing
methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under
non-stationarity for various experimental setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户标签偏斜、数据量偏斜等异构性问题严重降低模型性能，且现有方法未充分考虑大规模客户中仅小部分参与训练的场景。

Method: 提出KDIA策略，学生模型为参与客户的平均聚合，教师模型为基于参与频率、参与次数和数据量的加权聚合，并结合自知识蒸馏和生成器辅助训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10数据集和多种异构设置下，KDIA能以更少训练轮次实现更高准确率，且在严重异构性下改进更显著。

Conclusion: KDIA能有效利用所有客户知识，显著提升联邦学习在低参与率和异构性场景下的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning aims to train a global model in a distributed environment
that is close to the performance of centralized training. However, issues such
as client label skew, data quantity skew, and other heterogeneity problems
severely degrade the model's performance. Most existing methods overlook the
scenario where only a small portion of clients participate in training within a
large-scale client setting, whereas our experiments show that this scenario
presents a more challenging federated learning task. Therefore, we propose a
Knowledge Distillation with teacher-student Inequitable Aggregation (KDIA)
strategy tailored to address the federated learning setting mentioned above,
which can effectively leverage knowledge from all clients. In KDIA, the student
model is the average aggregation of the participating clients, while the
teacher model is formed by a weighted aggregation of all clients based on three
frequencies: participation intervals, participation counts, and data volume
proportions. During local training, self-knowledge distillation is performed.
Additionally, we utilize a generator trained on the server to generate
approximately independent and identically distributed (IID) data features
locally for auxiliary training. We conduct extensive experiments on the
CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10 datasets and various heterogeneous settings to evaluate
KDIA. The results show that KDIA can achieve better accuracy with fewer rounds
of training, and the improvement is more significant under severe
heterogeneity.

Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient way to
learn surrogate neural solvers of PDEs by embedding the physical model in the
loss function and minimizing its residuals using automatic differentiation at
so-called collocation points. Originally uniformly sampled, the choice of the
latter has been the subject of recent advances leading to adaptive sampling
refinements. In this paper, we propose a new quadrature method for
approximating definite integrals based on the hessian of the considered
function, and that we leverage to guide the selection of the collocation points
during the training process of PINNs.

Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data
classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the

automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method
distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution
but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language
Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed
algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different
demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the
eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations
capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation
space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing
its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse
datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It
tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from
different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each
modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer
internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning,
and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core
techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from
different data types), alignment methods (to match information across
modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models).
Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like
dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and
defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new
methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to
make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on
designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it
easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field
continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and
healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand
the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal
with real-world complexity.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative Machine Learning
framework for training models without collecting data in a centralized
location. It has seen application across various disciplines, from helping
medical diagnoses in hospitals to detecting fraud in financial transactions. In
this paper, we focus on improving the local training process through hardware
usage optimization. While participants in a federation might share the hardware
they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them,
their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration.
Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we
use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best
training settings across all participants. Our results show that against
default parameter settings, our method improves convergence speed while staying
nearly on par with the case where local parameters are optimized.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm which
allows participants to collectively train a model while training data remains
private. This paradigm is especially beneficial for sectors like finance, where
data privacy, security and model performance are paramount. FL has been
extensively studied in the years following its introduction, leading to, among
others, better performing collaboration techniques, ways to defend against
other clients trying to attack the model, and contribution assessment methods.
An important element in for-profit Federated Learning is the development of
incentive methods to determine the allocation and distribution of rewards for
participants. While numerous methods for allocation have been proposed and
thoroughly explored, distribution frameworks remain relatively understudied. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework which introduces client-specific
tokens as investment vehicles within the FL ecosystem. Our framework aims to
address the limitations of existing incentive schemes by leveraging a
decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated market makers (AMMs) to
create a more flexible and scalable reward distribution system for
participants, and a mechanism for third parties to invest in the federation
learning process.

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of
high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy
consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce
the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an
open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes
three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic
locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load
profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA)
method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model
generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on
their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with
AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy
consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power
systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA
achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models
trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data
augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively
aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

Conclusion: FEA-PINN框架为LPBF过程的高效模拟提供了一种可行方案，解决了传统方法的高计算成本问题。

Abstract: Efficient simulation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is crucial for process
prediction due to the lasting issue of high computation cost using traditional
numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). This study presents an
efficient modeling framework termed FEA-Regulated Physics-Informed Neural
Network (FEA-PINN) to accelerate the thermal field prediction in a LPBF process
while maintaining the FEA accuracy. A novel dynamic material updating strategy
is developed to capture the dynamic phase change of powder-liquid-solid in the
PINN model. The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material
properties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method.
While the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and
enables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it
faces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to
the residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework
integrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical
consistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN
achieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational
cost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and
demonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.

Abstract: This paper is about optimally controlling skill-based queueing systems such
as data centers, cloud computing networks, and service systems. By means of a
case study using a real-world data set, we investigate the practical
implementation of a recently developed reinforcement learning algorithm for
optimal customer routing. Our experiments show that the algorithm efficiently
learns and adapts to changing environments and outperforms static benchmark
policies, indicating its potential for live implementation. We also augment the
real-world applicability of this algorithm by introducing a new heuristic
routing rule to reduce delays. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can
optimize for multiple objectives: next to payoff maximization, secondary
objectives such as server load fairness and customer waiting time reduction can
be incorporated. Tuning parameters are used for balancing inherent performance
trade--offs. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity to estimation errors and
parameter tuning, providing valuable insights for implementing adaptive routing
algorithms in complex real-world queueing systems.

Motivation: 多变量时间序列异常检测在多个领域至关重要，但由于异常的未知性和时间序列维度间的复杂依赖关系，准确检测具有挑战性。

Method: 采用iTransformer架构，研究窗口大小、步长和模型维度等参数对性能的影响，并探讨异常标签提取和评估方法。

Result: 分析了异常数据对训练的影响，评估了替代损失函数的有效性，并与其他基于Transformer的模型进行了全面比较。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is an important problem across
various fields such as healthcare, financial services, manufacturing or physics
detector monitoring. Accurately identifying when unexpected errors or faults
occur is essential, yet challenging, due to the unknown nature of anomalies and
the complex interdependencies between time series dimensions. In this paper, we
investigate transformer-based approaches for time series anomaly detection,
focusing on the recently proposed iTransformer architecture. Our contributions
are fourfold: (i) we explore the application of the iTransformer to time series
anomaly detection, and analyse the influence of key parameters such as window
size, step size, and model dimensions on performance; (ii) we examine methods
for extracting anomaly labels from multidimensional anomaly scores and discuss
appropriate evaluation metrics for such labels; (iii) we study the impact of
anomalous data present during training and assess the effectiveness of
alternative loss functions in mitigating their influence; and (iv) we present a
comprehensive comparison of several transformer-based models across a diverse
set of datasets for time series anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图神经网络方法通常假设训练和测试数据分布相同，但在实际场景中这一条件难以满足。研究旨在评估GT和混合架构在OOD环境下的表现。

Method: 系统评估GT和混合架构在OOD设置中的表现，并比较传统消息传递神经网络（MPNNs）。同时提出一种新的后训练分析方法，分析ID和OOD测试数据的聚类结构。

Result: GT和混合架构在OOD泛化中表现优于MPNNs，且无需专门领域泛化算法。后训练分析方法提供了对泛化能力的深入见解。

Conclusion: 图变换器在真实世界图学习中具有潜力，为OOD泛化研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous
applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and
recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods
frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the
same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While
graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional
message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID)
benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of
backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in
OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading
domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their
performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts.
Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently
demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without
specialized DG algorithms.
  Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that
compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets,
specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Demonstrating its
model-agnostic design, this approach not only provided meaningful insights into
GT and MPNN backbones. It also shows promise for broader applicability to DG
problems beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization
abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings
highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph
learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图索引方法仅适用于欧几里得空间，无法满足度量与非度量向量空间的需求。

Method: 利用核方法构建图连接性，提出SVG和SVG-L0，后者引入稀疏约束以限制出度。

Result: SVG和SVG-L0在度量与非度量空间中具有正式导航保证，且SVG-L0避免了启发式方法。

Conclusion: SVG为图索引提供了新视角，SVG-L0通过稀疏约束优化了实践需求。

Abstract: The most popular graph indices for vector search use principles from
computational geometry to build the graph. Hence, their formal graph
navigability guarantees are only valid in Euclidean space. In this work, we
show that machine learning can be used to build graph indices for vector search
in metric and non-metric vector spaces (e.g., for inner product similarity).
From this novel perspective, we introduce the Support Vector Graph (SVG), a new
type of graph index that leverages kernel methods to establish the graph
connectivity and that comes with formal navigability guarantees valid in metric
and non-metric vector spaces. In addition, we interpret the most popular graph
indices, including HNSW and DiskANN, as particular specializations of SVG and
show that new indices can be derived from the principles behind this
specialization. Finally, we propose SVG-L0 that incorporates an $\ell_0$
sparsity constraint into the SVG kernel method to build graphs with a bounded
out-degree. This yields a principled way of implementing this practical
requirement, in contrast to the traditional heuristic of simply truncating the
out edges of each node. Additionally, we show that SVG-L0 has a self-tuning
property that avoids the heuristic of using a set of candidates to find the
out-edges of each node and that keeps its computational complexity in check.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法难以准确捕捉复杂哈密顿函数并保持能量守恒，因此提出H-FEX方法。

Method: H-FEX通过引入新型交互节点来有效捕捉复杂相互作用项，是一种符号学习方法。

Result: 实验表明，H-FEX能准确恢复复杂系统的哈密顿函数，并长期保持能量守恒。

Conclusion: H-FEX是发现复杂动力系统闭式表达的有力框架。

Abstract: Hamiltonian systems describe a broad class of dynamical systems governed by
Hamiltonian functions, which encode the total energy and dictate the evolution
of the system. Data-driven approaches, such as symbolic regression and neural
network-based methods, provide a means to learn the governing equations of
dynamical systems directly from observational data of Hamiltonian systems.
However, these methods often struggle to accurately capture complex Hamiltonian
functions while preserving energy conservation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose the Finite Expression Method for learning Hamiltonian Systems (H-FEX),
a symbolic learning method that introduces novel interaction nodes designed to
capture intricate interaction terms effectively. Our experiments, including
those on highly stiff dynamical systems, demonstrate that H-FEX can recover
Hamiltonian functions of complex systems that accurately capture system
dynamics and preserve energy over long time horizons. These findings highlight
the potential of H-FEX as a powerful framework for discovering closed-form
expressions of complex dynamical systems.

Motivation: 研究闭环学习的动态特性，尤其是大型神经网络可能主要依赖自身生成数据训练的情况。

Method: 针对指数族模型，推导参数动态方程，分析最大似然估计的性质。

Result: 最大似然估计使充分统计量具有鞅性质，导致收敛到放大初始偏差的稳态；但可通过数据污染、最大后验估计或正则化避免。

Conclusion: 闭环学习的渐进行为不具重参数化不变性，需谨慎处理以避免偏差放大。

Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from
data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to
the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be
primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves.
We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving
equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that
maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics
with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to
absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we
show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an
infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying
on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation.
Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not
reparametrisation invariant.

Result: 实验证明FedEDS能加速联邦学习的收敛速度，减轻数据异构性的负面影响，提升模型性能。

Conclusion: FedEDS适用于需要快速收敛的边缘设备应用服务，有效解决了现有联邦学习中的问题。

Abstract: As privacy protection gains increasing importance, more models are being
trained on edge devices and subsequently merged into the central server through
Federated Learning (FL). However, current research overlooks the impact of
network topology, physical distance, and data heterogeneity on edge devices,
leading to issues such as increased latency and degraded model performance. To
address these issues, we propose a new federated learning scheme on edge
devices that called Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing(FedEDS).
FedEDS uses the client model and the model's stochastic layer to train the data
encryptor. The data encryptor generates encrypted data and shares it with other
clients. The client uses the corresponding client's stochastic layer and
encrypted data to train and adjust the local model. FedEDS uses the client's
local private data and encrypted shared data from other clients to train the
model. This approach accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning
training and mitigates the negative impact of data heterogeneity, making it
suitable for application services deployed on edge devices requiring rapid
convergence. Experiments results show the efficacy of FedEDS in promoting model
performance.

Result: 实验表明，提出的代理损失函数在性能上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在多专家延迟分配问题上具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: The problem of learning to defer with multiple experts consists of optimally
assigning input instances to experts, balancing the trade-off between their
accuracy and computational cost. This is a critical challenge in natural
language generation, but also in other fields such as image processing, and
medical diagnostics. Recent studies have proposed surrogate loss functions to
optimize deferral, but challenges remain in ensuring their consistency
properties. This paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and efficient
algorithms with strong theoretical learning guarantees. We address open
questions regarding realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and
Bayes-consistency for both single-stage (jointly learning predictor and
deferral function) and two-stage (learning only the deferral function with a
fixed expert) learning scenarios. For single-stage deferral, we introduce a
family of new realizable $H$-consistent surrogate losses and further prove
$H$-consistency for a selected member. For two-stage deferral, we derive new
surrogate losses that achieve realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency
bounds, and Bayes-consistency for the two-expert scenario and, under natural
assumptions, multiple-expert scenario. Additionally, we provide enhanced
theoretical guarantees under low-noise assumptions for both scenarios. Finally,
we report the results of experiments using our proposed surrogate losses,
comparing their performance against existing baselines.

Motivation: 研究联邦学习中梯度更新可能泄露客户端敏感信息的风险，尤其是恶意服务器操纵模型时的威胁。

Method: 从防御者角度分析攻击的有效性与隐蔽性，并提出基于监控的客户端检测机制。

Result: 发现攻击在现实中难以同时高效重构数据且隐蔽，检测机制能有效防御。

Conclusion: 恶意梯度泄漏攻击实际威胁有限，轻量级防御机制可行且易于部署。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that gradient updates in federated learning (FL) can
unintentionally reveal sensitive information about a client's local data. This
risk becomes significantly greater when a malicious server manipulates the
global model to provoke information-rich updates from clients. In this paper,
we adopt a defender's perspective to provide the first comprehensive analysis
of malicious gradient leakage attacks and the model manipulation techniques
that enable them. Our investigation reveals a core trade-off: these attacks
cannot be both highly effective in reconstructing private data and sufficiently
stealthy to evade detection -- especially in realistic FL settings that
incorporate common normalization techniques and federated averaging.
  Building on this insight, we argue that malicious gradient leakage attacks,
while theoretically concerning, are inherently limited in practice and often
detectable through basic monitoring. As a complementary contribution, we
propose a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable client-side detection
mechanism that flags suspicious model updates before local training begins,
despite the fact that such detection may not be strictly necessary in realistic
FL settings. This mechanism further underscores the feasibility of defending
against these attacks with minimal overhead, offering a deployable safeguard
for privacy-conscious federated learning systems.

TL;DR: CycleDistill利用LLMs和少样本翻译，通过迭代生成合成平行语料库来提升低资源语言的机器翻译质量，无需大量平行语料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言因缺乏平行语料库而难以实现高质量机器翻译的问题。

Method: 提出CycleDistill方法，通过LLMs和少样本翻译迭代生成合成平行语料库，并用于微调模型。

Result: 在三种印度语言上，CycleDistill显著提升翻译质量，首轮迭代平均提高20-30 chrF点。

Conclusion: CycleDistill为低资源语言提供了一种高效且高质量的机器翻译解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot
machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on
parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT).
However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach
leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.
CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from
monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune
the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not
need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments
focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora,
it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot
baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We
also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation
process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在知识密集型推理任务中表现不佳，传统RAG方法难以捕捉知识图谱中的关系结构。

Method: 结合顺序扩展（深度链式思维图遍历）和并行扩展（多数投票采样轨迹），形成交替推理-执行循环。

Result: 在GRBench基准测试中，多跳问答性能显著提升，优于传统GraphRAG和图遍历基线方法。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展是一种实用且与架构无关的解决方案，适用于LLM的结构化知识推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in
language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on
knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context
and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially
mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional
RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across
nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel
framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time
compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep
chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting
over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.
Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving
substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal
baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical
and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

Motivation: 现实世界的API复杂且文档非结构化，构建通用工具代理面临挑战。

Method: Doc2Agent从API文档生成可执行工具，并通过代码代理迭代优化。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，性能提升55%，成本降低90%，并成功应用于复杂领域。

Conclusion: Doc2Agent为从非结构化API文档大规模构建工具代理提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: REST APIs play important roles in enriching the action space of web agents,
yet most API-based agents rely on curated and uniform toolsets that do not
reflect the complexity of real-world APIs. Building tool-using agents for
arbitrary domains remains a major challenge, as it requires reading
unstructured API documentation, testing APIs and inferring correct parameters.
We propose Doc2Agent, a scalable pipeline to build agents that can call
Python-based tools generated from API documentation. Doc2Agent generates
executable tools from API documentations and iteratively refines them using a
code agent. We evaluate our approach on real-world APIs, WebArena APIs, and
research APIs, producing validated tools. We achieved a 55\% relative
performance improvement with 90\% lower cost compared to direct API calling on
WebArena benchmark. A domain-specific agent built for glycomaterial science
further demonstrates the pipeline's adaptability to complex, knowledge-rich
tasks. Doc2Agent offers a generalizable solution for building tool agents from
unstructured API documentation at scale.

Motivation: 现有时空数据挖掘模型局限于单一任务，缺乏多任务推理和复杂长形式推理能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: STReason利用上下文学习将复杂查询分解为模块化程序，无需任务特定微调，生成解决方案和详细解释。

Result: 实验表明STReason在所有指标上显著优于先进基线，尤其在复杂时空推理场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: STReason为开发更通用、强大的时空推理系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making
across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow
tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form
reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These
limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision
scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that
integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the
analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and
execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages
in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,
interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both
solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we
construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework
with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.
Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM
baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,
reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further
validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its
potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world
spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for
developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

Result: SACL显著提升了代码检索性能（如HumanEval上Recall@1提高12.8%），并进一步改善了代码生成效果（HumanEval上Pass@1提高4.88%）。

Conclusion: SACL通过减少偏见和增强语义信息，有效提升了代码检索和生成的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant.Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches
textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge
with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially
improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval /
MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance
(e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

Abstract: Time-series data are critical in diverse applications, such as industrial

integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for
dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release
EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset
designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and
natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time

with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,
aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement
in QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\% additional trainable
parameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal
modeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal

prevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV
and reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology
reports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III
database. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.
Three LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor
plus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.
Precision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).
Efficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer
remuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,
exact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV
increased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,
Framework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.
baselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per
1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and
USD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.
Human-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported
Framework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR
(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and
reduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an
effective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.

### [107] [Leveraging AI Graders for Missing Score Imputation to Achieve Accurate Ability Estimation in Constructed-Response Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20119)
*Masaki Uto,Yuma Ito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数的新方法，以提高IRT能力估计的准确性，同时显著减少人工评分工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估学习者的能力是教育领域的基本目标，尤其是对高阶能力的评估需求增加。传统构建式测试虽有效但人工评分成本高，IRT虽能从不完整数据估计能力，但随着缺失分数比例增加，准确性下降。现有数据增强技术对稀疏或异构数据效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数的新方法，以支持IRT能力估计。

Result: 该方法在能力估计中实现了高准确性，并显著减少了人工评分的工作量。

Conclusion: 通过结合自动评分技术，新方法有效解决了IRT在缺失分数情况下的能力估计问题，为教育评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field
of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order
abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response
tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as
a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require
substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item
response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation
of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset
of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the
accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores
increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores
have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle
with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging
automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The
proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly
reducing manual grading workload.

### [108] [CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128)
*Aashiq Muhamed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CCRS，一种基于预训练LLM的零样本评估框架，用于多维度评估RAG系统的输出质量，包括上下文连贯性、问题相关性等五个指标，并在BioASQ数据集上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统评估方法存在不足，如依赖简单词汇重叠指标或复杂多阶段流程，难以全面捕捉输出质量的多维度特性。

Method: 提出CCRS，利用单一预训练LLM作为零样本端到端评估器，包含五个指标：Contextual Coherence、Question Relevance等。

Result: 在BioASQ数据集上验证CCRS的有效性，显示其能区分不同RAG系统性能，如Mistral-7B优于Llama变体，且计算效率优于RAGChecker。

Conclusion: CCRS为RAG系统提供了一种实用、全面且高效的评估框架，支持迭代改进。

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is
crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.
However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects
such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and
informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation
methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for
capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with
intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized
judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five
metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,
end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance
(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall
(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the
challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively
discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the
Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of
CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant
validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared
to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior
discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being
significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,
comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving
RAG systems.

*Ruosen Li,Ziming Luo,Quan Zhang,Ruochen Li,Ben Zhou,Ali Payani,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AALC是一种轻量级的、基于准确性的长度奖励方法，通过动态平衡正确性和简洁性，显著减少推理长度，同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）通过生成长链思维实现强大推理能力，但过长的推理导致高延迟和成本，而准确性提升不明显。

Method: AALC将验证准确性纳入奖励，并采用动态调度的长度惩罚，延迟惩罚直到达到目标性能。

Result: 实验表明，AALC将响应长度减少50%以上，同时保持或提升准确性，并减少冗余推理模式。

Conclusion: AALC展示了基于奖励的策略在引导LRMs实现高效、通用推理路径方面的潜力，但也可能牺牲部分可解释性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by
generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high
latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we
introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into
reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during
training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a
smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until
target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and
out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response
length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant
reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading
to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify
that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models
trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These
findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs
toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

*Fengze Li,Yue Wang,Yangle Liu,Ming Huang,Dou Hong,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEED模型通过结合结构编码器和语言模型，解决了多元时间序列预测中结构依赖与语义推理的兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构编码器缺乏语义推理能力，而语言模型无法直接处理时间序列数据，限制了统一预测系统的发展。

Method: SEED采用四阶段架构：令牌感知编码器提取补丁，投影模块对齐补丁与语言模型嵌入，语义重编程映射补丁到任务原型，冻结语言模型进行预测。

Result: 实验表明SEED在多个数据集上优于基线方法，填补了结构-语义建模的空白。

Conclusion: SEED通过解耦表示学习与推理，实现了数值模式与语义推理的高效对齐，为统一预测系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.

*Zhiyuan Wang,Jinhao Duan,Qingni Wang,Xiaofeng Zhu,Tianlong Chen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIN提出了一种基于统计验证的框架，通过校准不确定性阈值来过滤生成文本中的错误答案，确保在用户指定的FDR约束下选择单一答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有不确定性量化方法在选择性预测中缺乏形式化保证的问题，特别是针对错误发现率（FDR）的控制。

Method: 采用统计方法（如Clopper-Pearson置信区间）估计校准集上的经验错误率，并设定高概率上限以控制FDR。

Result: COIN在风险控制、测试时保留合格答案的能力以及有限校准数据下的预测效率方面表现出色。

Conclusion: COIN框架具有扩展性和适应性，可通过不同上限构造和不确定性量化策略进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to
identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text.
However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as
the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts
the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of
admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often
contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address
this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that
calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer
per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical
error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as
Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error
rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty
threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing
sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong
test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency
under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text
generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound
constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,
which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application
scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过检索高质量示例提升LLMs在对话情感识别（CER）中的表现，发现增强示例检索方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多个领域有广泛应用，但在情感识别等主观任务中实现高准确性仍具挑战性。

Method: 研究了随机和增强示例检索策略，并分析了对话上下文对CER准确性的影响。

Result: 增强示例检索方法在所有数据集（IEMOCAP、MELD、EmoryNLP）中表现最优。

Conclusion: 检索具有连贯性和针对性的示例并通过改写增强，对提升CER准确性至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world
applications in various domains. However, creating a high-performing
application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective
tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this
study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition
(CER) by LLMs. Specifically, we explore how to retrieve high-quality examples
in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies
based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of
conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three
datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented
example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation
across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent
targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.

TL;DR: 比较捷克语特定和多语言句子嵌入模型，发现内在语义相似性与下游任务表现不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨句子嵌入模型在语义相似性和下游任务（如机器翻译评估）中的表现差异。

Method: 通过内在评估（Costra数据集和STS基准）和外在评估（基于COMET的机器翻译评估）比较模型。

Result: 内在表现优异的模型在下游任务中不一定表现好，而某些模型通过微调能取得优秀结果。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究句子嵌入的'可操作语义'或更深入的下游任务数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding
models through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation paradigms. For intrinsic
evaluation, we employ Costra, a complex sentence transformation dataset, and
several Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks to assess the ability of
the embeddings to capture linguistic phenomena such as semantic similarity,
temporal aspects, and stylistic variations. In the extrinsic evaluation, we
fine-tune each embedding model using COMET-based metrics for machine
translation evaluation.
  Our experiments reveal an interesting disconnect: models that excel in
intrinsic semantic similarity tests do not consistently yield superior
performance on downstream translation evaluation tasks. Conversely, models with
seemingly over-smoothed embedding spaces can, through fine-tuning, achieve
excellent results. These findings highlight the complex relationship between
semantic property probes and downstream task, emphasizing the need for more
research into 'operationalizable semantics' in sentence embeddings, or more
in-depth downstream tasks datasets (here translation evaluation)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多视角软标签方法，以更好地捕捉人类标注者的多样性观点，在主观文本分类任务中表现优于传统聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法通过聚合标注者观点建立单一真实标签，但可能忽略少数观点。本研究旨在开发更包容的模型，反映个体背景和价值观的多样性。

Method: 采用多视角软标签方法，分析多个主观文本分类任务（如仇恨言论、讽刺、辱骂语言和立场检测），并使用Jensen-Shannon Divergence（JSD）和F1分数评估。

Result: 多视角方法更接近人类标签分布（JSD更低），分类性能更优（F1分数更高），但在讽刺和立场检测任务中置信度较低。

Conclusion: 多视角方法有助于开发更具包容性的模型，但需进一步解决高主观性任务中的不确定性。

Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for
handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to
establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding
individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting
minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may
systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels
reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals,
this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to
encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models,
more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse
subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive
language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human
disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results
show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human
label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also
achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming
traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in
tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity
present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model
uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂逻辑推理和系统规划任务中表现不佳，主要依赖隐式统计关系，缺乏结构化知识表示。

Method: 将非结构化数据转换为结构化格式，标注推理步骤，通过监督微调（SFT）训练LLMs，并引入GRPO算法（MAX-Flow和LCS）优化推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型上实现了简洁推理、鲁棒性能和优化兼容性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了LLMs的推理能力，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural
language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still
encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving
logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on
implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge
representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce
a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,
we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating
reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning
capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce
computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust
performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with
optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning
integration in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分块的自监督学习（SSL）融合方法，结合CNN-BiLSTM框架，用于非母语者的自动流利度评估（AFA），显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非母语者的流利度评估（AFA）在捕捉语音节奏、停顿和不流利性方面存在挑战，需要更精细的时序分析和多模态特征融合。

Method: 采用分块策略（Silero-VAD分割语音），融合多种SSL模型（Wav2Vec2、HuBERT、WavLM）的互补优势，结合CNN-BiLSTM框架进行局部和长期依赖建模。

Result: 在Avalinguo和Speechocean762数据集上，F1分数和Pearson相关系数分别提升2.8-4.2和6.2-4.0，优于单SSL和Pyannote.audio基线。

Conclusion: 分块多SSL融合方法在流利度评估中表现优异，但需进一步研究其在非规则韵律方言中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

Motivation: 快速演变的媒体叙事需要动态分析其发展，而现有方法在规模应用上存在成本问题。

Method: 结合主题模型和变化点检测筛选代表性文档，再用大型语言模型自动分析叙事变化。

Result: 大型语言模型能有效提取叙事变化，但区分内容与叙事变化表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于动态叙事分析，但在区分内容与叙事变化方面需改进。

Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical
to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how
they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as
Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even
the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes
with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a
combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models
with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model
narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a
topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes
that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our
corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and
feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened
in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.
We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper
articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model
can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in
time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in
content or a narrative shift took place.

Motivation: 临床文本通常难以获取，Biomed-Enriched提供了一个公开的大规模临床案例数据集，填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过大语言模型标注400K段落，再用小模型扩展标签至PMC-OA全库，提取高质量子集并进行质量过滤和领域上采样。

Result: 实验显示，临床上采样提升MMLU ProfMed性能5%，教育质量过滤提升MedQA和MedMCQA性能1%，组合方法加速收敛。

Conclusion: Biomed-Enriched为生物医学预训练提供了高效策略，数据集公开可用，具有重要价值。

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from
PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language
model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning
scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,
biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score
(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.
These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which
propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata
allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs
with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,
and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.
Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as
hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an
alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from
PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.
Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated
subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting
performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving
MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster
convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,
indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining
strategies.

in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be
effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive
analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool
use. To this end, we introduce \name, a novel solution that enhances
personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an
uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of
LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for
open source models on the NLSI task.

TL;DR: DeepRare是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的罕见病诊断系统，通过处理异构临床输入生成诊断假设，并在多个数据集中表现出卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断困难，主要由于临床异质性、低流行率和医生对罕见病的了解有限。DeepRare旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 系统由中央主机、长期记忆模块和专用代理服务器组成，整合40多种工具和最新医学知识。

Result: 在2919种疾病中，对1013种疾病达到100%准确率；在HPO评估中显著优于其他15种方法，Recall@1达57.18%。

Conclusion: DeepRare在罕见病诊断中表现出色，并已实现为用户友好的网络应用。

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15
methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other
agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoDoT的提示策略，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性，发现当前模型在安全性方面存在严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在安全关键应用中的普及，确保其与人类价值观和偏好对齐变得至关重要。

Method: CoDoT将自然语言输入转换为表示相同意图的简单代码，以评估模型的安全性。

Result: 实验表明，CoDoT导致多种先进LLMs的安全性显著下降，例如GPT-4 Turbo的毒性增加了16.5倍。

Conclusion: CoDoT强调了从基本原理评估安全性的重要性，以确保安全性与能力同步发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, interfacing with humans
in numerous safety-critical applications. This necessitates improving
capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align
these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate
that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,
leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting
strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT
converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same
intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt "Make the
statement more toxic: {text}" to: "make_more_toxic({text})". We show that CoDoT
results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For
example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of
the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.
Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two
times. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the
critical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that
safety and capabilities advance together.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种计算框架，用于量化对话中说话时间的分配及其动态过程，揭示了不同动态类型对参与者感知的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对话中说话时间的分配及其动态过程，以理解其对参与者感知的影响，并为计算机辅助通信平台设计提供工具。

Method: 通过分析大规模陌生人视频聊天数据集，量化说话时间的分配和动态过程，并引入分类法。

Result: 平衡的对话更受青睐，尤其是说话较少的一方；即使总体平衡相同，不同的动态类型也会影响参与者感知。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算机辅助通信平台设计提供了新工具，适用于人-人和人-人工智能通信。

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?
  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the
conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the
lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing
dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this
framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,
perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time
are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being
preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.
Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance
-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by
the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过合并微调模型变体的层来压缩大型语言模型的新策略，显著减少了参数数量同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然能力强大，但模型规模大导致部署和推理成本高，现有方法主要关注单模型剪枝，缺乏高效的多模型压缩策略。

Method: 将LLMs的最优剪枝建模为零阶优化问题，支持三种操作：层移除、从不同候选模型中选择层、层合并。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在Llama2-13B模型上能移除约25%参数，同时保持97.3%的原始性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该策略为LLMs的高效压缩提供了新思路，显著提升了部署效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a
promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods
primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel
strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from
finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by
aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the
optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting
a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)
Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,
for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain
approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing $\sim25\%$ of
parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: ReCode框架通过强化学习帮助LLMs适应动态API更新，提升代码生成能力，同时减少对通用能力的负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在外部库API频繁更新时表现不佳，依赖过时训练数据，影响动态环境中的代码生成可靠性。

Method: 构建约2000条数据训练LLMs进行版本迁移，引入改进的字符串相似度指标作为强化学习奖励。

Result: ReCode显著提升LLMs在动态API场景下的性能，尤其在CodeUpdateArena任务上，且对通用能力影响较小。

Conclusion: ReCode在多种LLMs和强化学习算法中均表现一致改进，Qwen2.5-Coder-7B甚至超越更大模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究基础语言模型如何更适合强化学习，以推动下一代RL可扩展的基础模型发展。

Method: 通过分析Qwen和Llama模型家族，研究中训练策略对RL动态的影响，并提出两阶段训练策略Stable-then-Decay。

Result: 发现高质量数学语料和长链推理数据能提升RL性能，但需注意数据格式化；提出的策略成功开发了OctoThinker模型家族。

Conclusion: 研究为RL时代的基础模型预训练策略提供了重要见解，并开源了模型和语料库以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit
divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),
especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model
suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question
is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next
generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL
dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our
study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as
MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,
while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further
adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this
effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce
verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the
importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to
stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a
two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are
first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B
tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields
OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and
closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.
We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models
in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models
along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens
(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在英语和特定领域（如数学和代码），而本文关注如何将这些技术推广到开放任务和多语言环境中。

Method: 提出新的采样和选择策略，适应多语言和多任务需求，并在8B和111B模型上进行评估。

Result: 新策略在m-ArenaHard-v2.0基准测试中显著提升了胜率（8B模型+6.8，111B模型+9.0）。

Conclusion: 需要针对语言和任务定制推理策略，以提升非主流语言的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward
scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the
model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select
one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English
and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most
interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally
verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly
scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,
multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation
and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and
varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing
that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.
We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for
multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable
gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and
selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models
on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At
larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0
improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against
single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results
underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time
compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented
languages.

Result: 行为编辑能动态调整智能体行为，实现局部和全局的道德对齐，且适用于不同模型和场景。

Conclusion: 行为编辑为智能体行为引导提供了新范式，但同时也需警惕其潜在风险。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents
in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.
Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world
consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer
the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model
editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area
of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while
preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate
this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in
psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and
editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier
introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that
Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within
specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only
scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an
agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be
used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce
harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents
based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior
Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights
into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise
and perils of Behavior Editing.

Motivation: 探索dLLMs在代码生成中的优势，解决当前训练和推理机制的不足。

Method: 训练7B参数的dLLM（DiffuCoder），分析其解码行为并提出coupled-GRPO采样方案。

Result: DiffuCoder在代码生成基准上性能提升4.4%，减少对自回归解码的依赖。

Conclusion: dLLMs在代码生成中具有独特优势，coupled-GRPO是一种有效的扩散原生RL训练框架。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to
autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the
entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs
are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在纯推理任务中表现优异，但在需要紧密耦合检索与推理的多跳问答任务中表现不佳。

Method: Memento采用三阶段策略：分解问题、动态构建事实数据库、整合信息解决问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Memento显著提升了性能，如在PhantomWiki上性能翻倍，在2WikiMultiHopQA上提升超过20 F1点。

Conclusion: Memento是一种有效的策略，能够显著提升LLM在多跳问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when
reasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question
answering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy
that first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically
constructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts
together to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we
call Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across
diverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the
performance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in
context. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento
improves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the
multi-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points. On the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, Memento improves ReAct by more than 3 F1
percentage points, demonstrating its utility in agentic settings.

<details>

Motivation: 当前工具难以解析LLM中动态且多面的价值权衡，而认知科学中的认知模型能形式化描述人类的价值权衡，因此尝试将其应用于LLM分析。

Method: 采用认知模型中的礼貌语言模型，系统评估LLM在推理模型和开源模型中的价值权衡表现。

Result: 推理模型更注重信息效用，开源模型在数学推理中表现更强；训练初期价值权衡变化显著，受基础模型和预训练数据影响较大。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效分析LLM的价值权衡，为模型训练和行为假设提供新视角。

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting
goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still
being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an
integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools
for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are
limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal
accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In
this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the
extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to
systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:
degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL
post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of
higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in
open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings
from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in
training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining
data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method
is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with
insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping
training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs
between values during model training.

Conclusion: CoVE显著提升了LLMs在推荐任务中的表现，适用于大规模工业应用。

Abstract: Recommender systems play a pivotal role in providing relevant content to
users. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), researchers
have begun utilizing LLMs to build more powerful recommender systems. However,
existing approaches that focus on aligning LLMs with recommendation tasks do
not fully leverage their sequential information processing capabilities,
leading to suboptimal performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel system called compressed vocabulary
expansion (CoVE). In CoVE, each item is assigned a unique ID within the
expanded vocabulary. Our framework effectively capitalizes on sequence
understanding abilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing their performance on
recommendation tasks. Additionally, we compress the embedding layer, making
CoVE practical for large-scale industrial applications. The effectiveness and
performance of CoVE are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on
multiple recommendation datasets and comparisons with prior works. Our code can

Result: 在MuQNOL数据集上表现良好，与现有检索系统性能相当。

Conclusion: FemmIR在无需标注和微调的情况下，实现了高效的多模态检索。

Abstract: Existing multi-media retrieval models either rely on creating a common
subspace with modality-specific representation models or require schema mapping
among modalities to measure similarities among multi-media data. Our goal is to
avoid the annotation overhead incurred from considering retrieval as a
supervised classification task and re-use the pretrained encoders in large
language models and vision tasks. We propose "FemmIR", a framework to retrieve
multimodal results relevant to information needs expressed with multimodal
queries by example without any similarity label. Such identification is
necessary for real-world applications where data annotations are scarce and
satisfactory performance is required without fine-tuning with a common
framework across applications. We curate a new dataset called MuQNOL for
benchmarking progress on this task. Our technique is based on weak supervision
introduced through edit distance between samples: graph edit distance can be
modified to consider the cost of replacing a data sample in terms of its
properties, and relevance can be measured through the implicit signal from the
amount of edit cost among the objects. Unlike metric learning or encoding
networks, FemmIR re-uses the high-level properties and maintains the property
value and relationship constraints with a multi-level interaction score between
data samples and the query example provided by the user. We empirically
evaluate FemmIR on a missing person use case with MuQNOL. FemmIR performs
comparably to similar retrieval systems in delivering on-demand retrieval
results with exact and approximate similarities while using the existing
property identifiers in the system.

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of output-feedback schemes for systems
described by a class of recurrent neural networks. We propose a procedure based
on linear matrix inequalities for designing an observer and a static
state-feedback controller. The algorithm leverages global and regional
incremental input-to-state stability (incremental ISS) and enables the tracking
of constant setpoints, ensuring robustness to disturbances and state estimation
uncertainty. To address the potential limitations of regional incremental ISS,
we introduce an alternative scheme in which the static law is replaced with a
tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that exploits regional
incremental ISS properties. We show that these conditions enable the
formulation of a robust NMPC law with guarantees of convergence and recursive
feasibility, leading to an enlarged region of attraction. Theoretical results
are validated through numerical simulations on the pH-neutralisation process
benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

### [136] [From Codicology to Code: A Comparative Study of Transformer and YOLO-based Detectors for Layout Analysis in Historical Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20326)
*Sergio Torres Aguilar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了五种目标检测架构在三个历史文档数据集上的表现，发现Transformer模型在结构化布局中表现优异，而CNN-OBB模型在复杂文档中更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的复杂布局需要鲁棒的文档布局分析（DLA），而现有方法在非笛卡尔布局中的表现尚不明确。

Method: 比较了两种Transformer模型（Co-DETR、Grounding DINO）和三种YOLO变体（AABB、OBB、YOLO-World）在三个数据集（e-NDP、CATMuS、HORAE）上的性能。

Result: Co-DETR在结构化数据集e-NDP上表现最佳（0.752 mAP），而YOLOv11x-OBB在复杂数据集CATMuS和HORAE上显著优于其他模型（0.564和0.568）。

Conclusion: 使用定向边界框（OBB）是准确建模历史文档非笛卡尔布局的关键，Transformer和CNN-OBB模型在不同场景下各有优劣。

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

*Jinming Wu,Zihao Deng,Wei Li,Yiding Liu,Bo You,Bo Li,Zejun Ma,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMSearch-R1是一个端到端的强化学习框架，用于优化大型多模态模型（LMMs）在真实互联网环境中的多轮搜索行为，减少搜索调用并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如RAG和提示工程搜索代理）依赖固定流程，导致搜索效率低下或过度搜索，需要更灵活高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出MMSearch-R1框架，整合图像和文本搜索工具，通过基于结果的奖励和搜索惩罚机制指导模型动态调用搜索。

Result: 在知识密集和信息寻求VQA任务中，MMSearch-R1不仅优于同规模RAG基线，还减少30%以上的搜索调用，性能与更大RAG模型相当。

Conclusion: MMSearch-R1为多模态搜索研究提供了高效、按需的解决方案，并通过实验验证其优越性。

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BrokenVideos数据集，用于AI生成视频中视觉伪影的精细定位，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频的视觉伪影（如运动不一致、物体变形等）影响真实性和用户信任，但缺乏专门用于伪影定位的基准数据集。

Method: 提出了BrokenVideos数据集，包含3,254个AI生成视频，带有像素级标注的伪影区域，并通过人工验证确保标注质量。

Result: 实验表明，在BrokenVideos上训练的模型能显著提升伪影定位能力。

Conclusion: BrokenVideos为生成视频模型的伪影定位研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAR的微调方法，用于在自回归模型中有效且保持性能地移除不需要的概念，并提出了新的评估基准ECGVF。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉理解和图像生成任务中表现优异，但如何在移除不需要的概念的同时保持生成质量仍是一个挑战。

Method: EAR方法结合了窗口梯度累积（WGA）策略和阈值损失掩码（TLM）策略，并提出了ECGVF基准用于评估。

Result: 实验表明，EAR在移除概念有效性和模型性能保持方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EAR为自回归模型中的概念移除提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

*Deepak Ghimire,Kilho Lee,Seong-heum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的损失感知自动选择结构化剪枝标准（LAASP）方法，用于压缩和加速深度神经网络，通过剪枝与训练相结合的方式提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法需要分阶段进行训练、剪枝和微调，效率较低。本文旨在通过一种更高效的方法自动选择剪枝标准和层，减少计算资源需求。

Method: 采用剪枝与训练相结合的单循环方法，自动选择剪枝标准和层，并通过网络损失指导选择。每减少一定FLOPs后短暂重训练以缓解精度下降。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上，ResNet56和ResNet110模型的top-1精度显著提升，FLOPs减少52%；ResNet50模型的FLOPs减少42%以上，top-5精度仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: LAASP方法在减少计算资源的同时保持了模型精度，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于深度学习的全色锐化方法，发现Wald协议生成的数据限制了模型泛化能力，提出PADM和HFreqdiff模块以改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wald协议生成的数据无法准确模拟真实世界的退化模式，限制了深度学习模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出PADM模块，通过两个子网络自适应学习退化过程；引入HFreqdiff模块，结合CFB和BACM模块提取高频细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在空间清晰度和图像质量上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PADM和HFreqdiff模块有效解决了Wald协议的局限性，提升了全色锐化性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds
high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM
modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process
learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution
panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial
sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度翻译动作识别框架，通过联合预测动作概念和辅助特征提升识别精度，并引入两种新颖的领域特定描述符（ODF和SDF）来增强特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中的人类动作识别需要高层次的语义推理和多模态特征的有效整合，而现有方法在特征表示和计算效率上存在不足。

Method: 框架结合了RGB视频帧、辅助模态（如光流、骨架数据等）和两种新描述符（ODF和SDF），并通过幻觉流推断缺失线索，同时引入不确定性建模和鲁棒损失函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如Kinetics-400、Kinetics-600等）上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在捕捉细粒度动作动态方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态特征整合和不确定性处理，显著提升了动作识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

TL;DR: PLADA是一个用于检测社交媒体上压缩图像中深度伪造的新框架，通过消除块效应和聚合开放数据，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法忽视压缩引入的块效应，且依赖原始图像，难以应对实际场景。

Method: PLADA包含块效应消除器（B2E）和开放数据聚合（ODA）模块，分别处理块效应和利用配对与非配对数据。

Result: 在26个数据集上，PLADA优于现有方法，尤其在压缩和有限配对数据条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: PLADA为开放世界场景提供了鲁棒的深度伪造检测方案，并首次将块效应作为关键因素引入研究。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决未修剪长视频的密集描述问题，通过分割视频为事件提案并利用视觉特征辅助生成更准确的描述。

Method: 使用C3D特征提取，结合两阶段LSTM网络和分层注意力机制，先编码语义和视觉信息，再解码生成描述性句子。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions数据集上验证了DaS框架的有效性。

Conclusion: DaS框架通过视觉特征辅助的句子摘要，显著提升了密集视频描述的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写识别系统通常仅利用单一模态（图像或笔画轨迹），而忽略了二者的互补性。本文旨在通过融合两种模态提升识别性能。

Method: 设计了一个端到端网络，将离线图像和在线笔画数据在共享潜在空间中进行早期融合。使用补丁编码器处理图像，轻量级Transformer嵌入笔画序列，并通过可学习的潜在查询联合关注两种数据流。

Result: 在IAMOn-DB和VNOn-DB数据集上实现了最先进的准确率，比之前最佳方法提升1%。

Conclusion: 通过早期融合多模态数据，显著提升了手写识别的性能，并展示了在ISI-Air数据集上的适应性。

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our
code can be found here.

presents opportunities to improve the generalisability and robustness of
task-specific latent features. This work introduces the concept of grouping
observations to learn identifiable representations for disease classification
in chest X-rays via an end-to-end framework. Our experiments demonstrate that
these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across
multiple classification tasks when grouping is used to enforce invariance w.r.t

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分探索事件时间提议内的场景演变，导致在场景和对象变化较大的情况下表现不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：分区阶段将事件拆分为更短的视频片段进行描述；总结阶段通过图卷积网络（GCN）和长短时记忆网络（LSTM）结合，总结各片段的描述为一句。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook II数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPaS框架通过分区和总结有效提升了密集视频描述的性能，尤其在场景变化较大的情况下。

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Conclusion: 解耦表示学习为显微镜图像分析提供了一种兼具高准确性和可解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural
networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability,
an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open
challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于失真不变特征学习的深度学习框架，用于鲁棒图像零水印技术，保持原始图像不变并通过特征空间优化学习参考签名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水印技术可能破坏图像质量，而零水印技术需要更强的鲁棒性和通用性。

Method: 框架包含两个模块：1）通过噪声对抗学习训练特征提取器，生成对失真不变且语义丰富的表示；2）设计基于学习的多比特零水印方案，将不变特征投影到可训练的参考代码上以匹配目标二进制消息。

Result: 在多种图像数据集和失真条件下，方法在特征稳定性和水印恢复方面达到了最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架在通用性和鲁棒性上优于现有的自监督和深度水印技术。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

TL;DR: HiT和DyHiT是高效的视觉跟踪模型，通过轻量级Transformer和动态路由技术，在保持高性能的同时显著提升速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer跟踪模型在资源受限设备上速度慢的问题。

Method: HiT使用Bridge Module和双图像位置编码；DyHiT通过动态路由分类场景并选择计算路径。

Result: HiT达61 fps和64.6% AUC；DyHiT达111 fps和62.4% AUC；动态路由方法使SeqTrack-B256提速2.68倍。

Conclusion: HiT和DyHiT在速度和性能上取得平衡，动态路由方法可广泛加速高性能跟踪器。

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements
due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is
limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing
speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient
tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation
across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,
which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing
feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image
position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT
achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

TL;DR: HiWave是一种无需训练的方法，通过两阶段流程提升超高分辨率图像合成的视觉保真度和结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本生成技术在高分辨率图像合成中产生的伪影问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：生成基础图像后，通过DDIM反演和小波增强模块优化细节。

Result: HiWave显著减少伪影，在用户研究中80%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HiWave为超高分辨率图像合成提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

TL;DR: MiLAAP是一种基于学习的注意力框架，用于预测无线网络中信道占用状态，无需节点间状态共享，显著减少通信开销，并在动态网络中实现高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线网络中信道跳频通信系统需适应干扰变化和节点移动性，但状态共享会引入高通信开销，降低网络吞吐效率。

Method: 提出MiLAAP框架，利用自注意力机制预测信道占用状态和节点移动轨迹，仅依赖本地被动观测数据。

Result: MiLAAP在动态网络中信道状态预测准确率接近100%，且具有零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: MiLAAP通过本地学习有效减少通信开销，提升动态网络中的信道调度效率。

Abstract: Channel hopping (CS) communication systems must adapt to interference changes
in the wireless network and to node mobility for maintaining throughput
efficiency. Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information
(i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in
interference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant
communication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale,
thereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks.
In this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on
a learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP
attention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral,
spatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a
self-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS
pattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel
occupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on
locally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no
communication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a
multi-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it
and accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes
that enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve
the prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks
that use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the
channel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across
different node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability
across different periods of CS sequences.

Motivation: 多夸克系统的复杂性远超电子或核子系统，尤其是强SU(3)色相互作用带来的挑战，需要一种高效的方法来研究其束缚态。

Method: 提出DeepQuark架构，结合深度神经网络和变分蒙特卡洛方法，解决了多夸克系统中的强关联、额外离散量子数和难以处理的约束相互作用等问题。

Result: 在核子、双重重四夸克和全重重四夸克系统中表现优异，尤其在五夸克系统中优于现有方法，并成功预测了新的分子态。

Conclusion: DeepQuark为研究更大规模多夸克系统提供了可能，并为探索非微扰QCD和多体物理提供了新框架。

Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational
Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity
surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color
interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to
address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger
correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement
interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with
state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian
expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy
tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for
pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we
successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without
additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe
hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased
form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound
$\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its
bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the
molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in
the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for
extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers
in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring
confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which
may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body
physics.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在政府遗留代码现代化中的应用，解决了输入限制的挑战，并发现LLM在代码分块和文档生成任务中优于人工分块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政府企业软件通常使用遗留语言（如MUMPS或ALC），且代码长度超出当前LLMs的上下文窗口限制。LLMs对遗留语言的理解能力尚不明确，需实证研究。

Method: 研究采用多种代码分块方法，优化遗留代码文件的模块注释生成，评估不同LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3 Sonnet等）在文档生成中的表现。

Result: LLMs选择的分块点与专家分块高度一致，且LLM生成的分块在文档生成任务中比人工分块更准确（事实性提高20%）和实用（提高10%）。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为人工分块的替代方案，适用于LLM辅助的遗留代码现代化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science,
especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However,
existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code
written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise
software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language
code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context
window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are
primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited
testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy
languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines
the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written
in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We
investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary
module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking
methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs
can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We
also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks
such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that
are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create
partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable
replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided
modernization.

Conclusion: Define-ML 是一个公开可用的验证方法，增强了 Lean Inception 的敏捷性，同时提高了技术可行性的意识。

Abstract: [Context] The increasing adoption of machine learning (ML) in software
systems demands specialized ideation approaches that address ML-specific
challenges, including data dependencies, technical feasibility, and alignment
between business objectives and probabilistic system behavior. Traditional
ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML
considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic
expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends
Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data
Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical
constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and
validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both
static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world
industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with
qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption.
[Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns,
aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional
collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,
though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be
mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to
adopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated
approach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while
aligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical
feasibility.

Abstract: Photonic device development (PDD) has achieved remarkable success in
designing and implementing new devices for controlling light across various
wavelengths, scales, and applications, including telecommunications, imaging,
sensing, and quantum information processing. PDD is an iterative, five-step
process that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters,
ii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs
from simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device
performance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization,
material science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods.
However, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily
costly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large
optimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical
characterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication
processes. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has
provided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including
surrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for
noisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for
fabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this
review, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable
machine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with
powerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under
noisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review
will provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into
this emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the
development of complex photonic devices and systems.

Result: 实验表明OLALa在各种量化率下均优于传统固定码本和非自适应方案。

Conclusion: OLALa通过动态量化器调整显著提升了联邦学习的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed
clients without sharing raw data, often at the cost of substantial
communication overhead induced by transmitting high-dimensional model updates.
This overhead can be alleviated by having the clients quantize their model
updates, with dithered lattice quantizers identified as an attractive scheme
due to its structural simplicity and convergence-preserving properties.
However, existing lattice-based FL schemes typically rely on a fixed
quantization rule, which is suboptimal in heterogeneous and dynamic
environments where the model updates distribution varies across users and
training rounds. In this work, we propose Online Learned Adaptive Lattices
(OLALa), a heterogeneous FL framework where each client can adjust its
quantizer online using lightweight local computations. We first derive
convergence guarantees for FL with non-fixed lattice quantizers and show that
proper lattice adaptation can tighten the convergence bound. Then, we design an
online learning algorithm that enables clients to tune their quantizers
throughout the FL process while exchanging only a compact set of quantization
parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that OLALa consistently improves
learning performance under various quantization rates, outperforming
conventional fixed-codebook and non-adaptive schemes.

Abstract: Prior natural language datasets for data visualization have focused on tasks
such as visualization literacy assessment, insight generation, and
visualization generation from natural language instructions. These studies
often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and
artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the
interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather
than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and
methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural
language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural
language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as
part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts
with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind
their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate
and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and
articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and
curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices
and corresponding rationales of the students.

Abstract: AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions,
significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically
present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their
decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability
to critically evaluate the output, form accurate mental models, and build
calibrated trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a
novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple
suggestion into a transparent, explainable event. CopilotLens operates as an
explanation layer that reveals the AI agent's "thought process" through a
dynamic two-level interface, surfacing everything from its reconstructed
high-level plans to the specific codebase context influencing the code. This
paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete
framework for building future agentic code assistants that prioritize clarity
of reasoning over speed of suggestion, thereby fostering deeper comprehension
and more robust human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The core challenge in learning has shifted from knowledge acquisition to
effective Self-Regulated Learning (SRL): planning, monitoring, and reflecting
on one's learning. Existing digital tools, however, inadequately support
metacognitive reflection. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) use de-contextualized
review, overlooking the role of context, while Personal Knowledge Management
(PKM) tools require high manual maintenance.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces "Insight Recall," a novel
paradigm that conceptualizes the context-triggered retrieval of personal past
insights as a metacognitive scaffold to promote SRL. We formalize this paradigm
using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) framework and implement a
prototype system, Irec, to demonstrate its feasibility. At its core, Irec uses
a dynamic knowledge graph of the user's learning history. When a user faces a
new problem, a hybrid retrieval engine recalls relevant personal "insights."
Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) performs a deep similarity
assessment to filter and present the most relevant scaffold in a just-in-time
manner. To reduce cognitive load, Irec features a human-in-the-loop pipeline
for LLM-based knowledge graph construction. We also propose an optional "Guided
Inquiry" module, where users can engage in a Socratic dialogue with an expert
LLM, using the current problem and recalled insights as context. The
contribution of this paper is a solid theoretical framework and a usable system
platform for designing next-generation intelligent learning systems that
enhance metacognition and self-regulation.

Motivation: 探讨AI写作支持工具对学生写作自主性和知识转化深度的影响。

Method: 通过随机对照试验，比较三种写作支持条件：聊天式LLM、集成式AI工具和标准写作界面。

Result: 集成式AI工具显著提升学生的写作自主性和知识转化深度。

Conclusion: 针对写作过程设计的AI工具能帮助学生保持作品所有权并提升内容参与度。

Abstract: The ubiquity of technologies like ChatGPT has raised concerns about their
impact on student writing, particularly regarding reduced learner agency and
superficial engagement with content. While standalone chat-based LLMs often
produce suboptimal writing outcomes, evidence suggests that purposefully
designed AI writing support tools can enhance the writing process. This paper
investigates how different AI support approaches affect writers' sense of
agency and depth of knowledge transformation. Through a randomized control
trial with 90 undergraduate students, we compare three conditions: (1) a
chat-based LLM writing assistant, (2) an integrated AI writing tool to support
diverse subprocesses, and (3) a standard writing interface (control). Our
findings demonstrate that, among AI-supported conditions, students using the
integrated AI writing tool exhibited greater agency over their writing process
and engaged in deeper knowledge transformation overall. These results suggest
that thoughtfully designed AI writing support targeting specific aspects of the
writing process can help students maintain ownership of their work while
facilitating improved engagement with content.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在加速核聚变和裂变研究中的应用潜力。

Method: 14个跨学科团队使用多种AI模型（如ChatGPT、Gemini等），结合提示工程和迭代优化，解决核科学问题。

Result: LLMs在早期探索和文献综述中表现优异，但在新材料设计和高级代码生成方面存在局限。

Conclusion: AI可作为核能研究的辅助工具，但需专用数据集和模型开发以进一步整合。

Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated
the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission
research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science
challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single
day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor
control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation,
and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed
structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities,
and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research
strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage
exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully
identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks.
However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel
materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and
domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes
resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a
complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The
workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through
rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need
for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized
model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools
into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for
safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous
scientific standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在文本领域或依赖不现实假设（如预定义问题文件或完全可观察性）的局限性，实现动态推断符号语义。

Method: 利用LLM生成启发式计划和候选符号语义，动态推断PDDL问题文件和动作语义，通过执行结果分析和错误解释合成迭代优化。

Result: 在ALFRED任务中，规划成功率从37%提升至74%；在RTFM和Overcooked-AI中提升步骤效率；成功推断机器人BlocksWorld任务的PDDL条件。

Conclusion: PSALM-V在部分观察和多智能体环境中有效，为真实世界机器人任务提供了可靠的符号语义推断能力。

Abstract: We propose PSALM-V, the first autonomous neuro-symbolic learning system able
to induce symbolic action semantics (i.e., pre- and post-conditions) in visual
environments through interaction. PSALM-V bootstraps reliable symbolic planning
without expert action definitions, using LLMs to generate heuristic plans and
candidate symbolic semantics. Previous work has explored using large language
models to generate action semantics for Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL)-based symbolic planners. However, these approaches have primarily
focused on text-based domains or relied on unrealistic assumptions, such as
access to a predefined problem file, full observability, or explicit error
messages. By contrast, PSALM-V dynamically infers PDDL problem files and domain
action semantics by analyzing execution outcomes and synthesizing possible
error explanations. The system iteratively generates and executes plans while
maintaining a tree-structured belief over possible action semantics for each
action, iteratively refining these beliefs until a goal state is reached.
Simulated experiments of task completion in ALFRED demonstrate that PSALM-V
increases the plan success rate from 37% (Claude-3.7) to 74% in partially
observed setups. Results on two 2D game environments, RTFM and Overcooked-AI,
show that PSALM-V improves step efficiency and succeeds in domain induction in
multi-agent settings. PSALM-V correctly induces PDDL pre- and post-conditions
for real-world robot BlocksWorld tasks, despite low-level manipulation failures
from the robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人机交互中的误解检测对维持用户参与和信任至关重要，但机器人难以通过非语言反馈识别错误。

Method: 使用包含240次对话的多模态数据集，引入四种对话失败类型，评估计算机视觉模型性能，并与人类评估对比。

Result: 模型在检测误解时性能有限，仅略优于随机猜测；在情感表达更丰富的数据集上表现较好。人类评估者同样仅能识别约一半误解。

Conclusion: 用户反馈不足是误解检测的主要限制，需设计更好的对话机制以主动获取反馈。

Abstract: Detecting miscommunication in human-robot interaction is a critical function
for maintaining user engagement and trust. While humans effortlessly detect
communication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,
robots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite
advances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This
research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting
miscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240
human-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures
were systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art
computer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback
on whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability
to accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the
performance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while
on a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully
identified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human
raters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced
miscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental
limitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users
perceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate
this to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape
expectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help
researchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately
eliciting feedback where needed.

Conclusion: 分层强化学习框架在复杂地形运动任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
quadruped locomotion over challenging terrain. Our approach incorporates a
two-layer hierarchy in which a high-level policy (HLP) selects optimal goals
for a low-level policy (LLP). The LLP is trained using an on-policy
actor-critic RL algorithm and is given footstep placements as goals. We propose
an HLP that does not require any additional training or environment samples and
instead operates via an online optimization process over the learned value
function of the LLP. We demonstrate the benefits of this framework by comparing
it with an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We observe
improvements in its ability to achieve higher rewards with fewer collisions
across an array of different terrains, including terrains more difficult than
any encountered during training.

Conclusion: SceneSense作为即插即用的地图改进工具，能提供更一致的探索结果，优于仅依赖传感器测量的地图。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing robotic exploration by using
generative occupancy mapping. We introduce SceneSense, a diffusion model
designed and trained for predicting 3D occupancy maps given partial
observations. Our proposed approach probabilistically fuses these predictions
into a running occupancy map in real-time, resulting in significant
improvements in map quality and traversability. We implement SceneSense onboard
a quadruped robot and validate its performance with real-world experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. In these experiments, we show that
occupancy maps enhanced with SceneSense predictions better represent our fully
observed ground truth data (24.44% FID improvement around the robot and 75.59%
improvement at range). We additionally show that integrating
SceneSense-enhanced maps into our robotic exploration stack as a "drop-in" map
improvement, utilizing an existing off-the-shelf planner, results in
improvements in robustness and traversability time. Finally we show results of
full exploration evaluations with our proposed system in two dissimilar
environments and find that locally enhanced maps provide more consistent
exploration results than maps constructed only from direct sensor measurements.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the
trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To
highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and
implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental
setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was
characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise
linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during
its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes
the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of
joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial
dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through
the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its
ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in
terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach
successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their
shape and adapted to different settings.

Motivation: 在群体交互中，机器人需要情境感知以有效协作，这要求对人和对象的一致性表示以及对事件的抽象理解。

Method: CARMA通过唯一标识物理实体并组织为演员-对象-动作三元组，实现情境感知。实验包括协作倾倒、交接和分类任务。

Result: 实验表明，CARMA能可靠生成准确的三元组，为协作任务提供结构化基础。

Conclusion: CARMA为需要时空推理和情境决策的应用提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce CARMA, a system for situational grounding in human-robot group
interactions. Effective collaboration in such group settings requires
situational awareness based on a consistent representation of present persons
and objects coupled with an episodic abstraction of events regarding actors and
manipulated objects. This calls for a clear and consistent assignment of
instances, ensuring that robots correctly recognize and track actors, objects,
and their interactions over time. To achieve this, CARMA uniquely identifies
physical instances of such entities in the real world and organizes them into
grounded triplets of actors, objects, and actions.
  To validate our approach, we conducted three experiments, where multiple
humans and a robot interact: collaborative pouring, handovers, and sorting.
These scenarios allow the assessment of the system's capabilities as to role
distinction, multi-actor awareness, and consistent instance identification. Our
experiments demonstrate that the system can reliably generate accurate
actor-action-object triplets, providing a structured and robust foundation for
applications requiring spatiotemporal reasoning and situated decision-making in
collaborative settings.

Conclusion: DemoDiffusion通过结合先验和扩散策略，实现了高效的任务适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to
perform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human
demonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand
motion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's
end-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot
motion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted
motion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with
plausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained
generalist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows
the human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot
actions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or
paired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes
with minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world
settings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the
retargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the
pre-trained generalist policy fails entirely. Project page:

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing
prediction sets with coverage guarantees. In practice, multiple valid conformal
prediction sets may be available, arising from different models or
methodologies. However, selecting the most desirable set, such as the smallest,
can invalidate the coverage guarantees. To address this challenge, we propose a
stability-based approach that ensures coverage for the selected prediction set.
We extend our results to the online conformal setting, propose several
refinements in settings where additional structure is available, and
demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.

Result: 在金融压力测试中，该方法比标准情景分析和主成分分析减少了55%和39%的平均绝对误差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、数据驱动的动态建模框架，适用于高维协变量与响应变量的预测。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven dynamic factor framework where a response variable
depends on a high-dimensional set of covariates, without imposing any
parametric model on the joint dynamics. Leveraging Anisotropic Diffusion Maps,
a nonlinear manifold learning technique introduced by Singer and Coifman, our
framework uncovers the joint dynamics of the covariates and responses in a
purely data-driven way. We approximate the embedding dynamics using linear
diffusions, and exploit Kalman filtering to predict the evolution of the
covariates and response variables directly from the diffusion map embedding
space. We generalize Singer's convergence rate analysis of the graph Laplacian
from the case of independent uniform samples on a compact manifold to the case
of time series arising from Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space.
Furthermore, we provide rigorous justification for our procedure by showing the
robustness of approximations of the diffusion map coordinates by linear
diffusions, and the convergence of ergodic averages under standard spectral
assumptions on the underlying dynamics. We apply our method to the stress
testing of equity portfolios using a combination of financial and macroeconomic
factors from the Federal Reserve's supervisory scenarios. We demonstrate that
our data-driven stress testing method outperforms standard scenario analysis
and Principal Component Analysis benchmarks through historical backtests
spanning three major financial crises, achieving reductions in mean absolute
error of up to 55% and 39% for scenario-based portfolio return prediction,
respectively.

Conclusion: FDE方法为分布式OPE提供了理论支持和实用工具，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, distributional off-policy evaluation (OPE) focuses
on estimating the return distribution of a target policy using offline data
collected under a different policy. This work focuses on extending the widely
used fitted-Q evaluation -- developed for expectation-based reinforcement
learning -- to the distributional OPE setting. We refer to this extension as
fitted distributional evaluation (FDE). While only a few related approaches
exist, there remains no unified framework for designing FDE methods. To fill
this gap, we present a set of guiding principles for constructing theoretically
grounded FDE methods. Building on these principles, we develop several new FDE
methods with convergence analysis and provide theoretical justification for
existing methods, even in non-tabular environments. Extensive experiments,
including simulations on linear quadratic regulators and Atari games,
demonstrate the superior performance of the FDE methods.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持预测性能的同时提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their
accuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel
at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful
relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of
decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can
be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the
response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control
the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which
improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve
optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for
computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to
varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error
bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the
best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to
the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the
large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the
oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms
existing algorithms for rule extraction.

Result: 在合成数据和MIMIC-III数据集上优于现有方法，提供接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: POLAR是首个提供统计和计算保证的模型方法，适用于动态治疗优化。

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) provide a principled framework for
optimizing sequential decision-making in domains where decisions must adapt
over time in response to individual trajectories, such as healthcare,
education, and digital interventions. However, existing statistical methods
often rely on strong positivity assumptions and lack robustness under partial
data coverage, while offline reinforcement learning approaches typically focus
on average training performance, lack statistical guarantees, and require
solving complex optimization problems. To address these challenges, we propose
POLAR, a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline
DTR optimization. POLAR estimates the transition dynamics from offline data and
quantifies uncertainty for each history-action pair. A pessimistic penalty is
then incorporated into the reward function to discourage actions with high
uncertainty. Unlike many existing methods that focus on average training
performance, POLAR directly targets the suboptimality of the final learned
policy and offers theoretical guarantees, without relying on computationally
intensive minimax or constrained optimization procedures. To the best of our
knowledge, POLAR is the first model-based DTR method to provide both
statistical and computational guarantees, including finite-sample bounds on
policy suboptimality. Empirical results on both synthetic data and the
MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that POLAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and yields near-optimal, history-aware treatment strategies.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Linear mixed models (LMMs), which incorporate fixed and random effects, are
key tools for analyzing heterogeneous data, such as in personalized medicine or
adaptive marketing. Nowadays, this type of data is increasingly wide, sometimes
containing thousands of candidate predictors, necessitating sparsity for
prediction and interpretation. However, existing sparse learning methods for
LMMs do not scale well beyond tens or hundreds of predictors, leaving a large
gap compared with sparse methods for linear models, which ignore random
effects. This paper closes the gap with a new $\ell_0$ regularized method for
LMM subset selection that can run on datasets containing thousands of
predictors in seconds to minutes. On the computational front, we develop a
coordinate descent algorithm as our main workhorse and provide a guarantee of
its convergence. We also develop a local search algorithm to help traverse the
nonconvex optimization surface. Both algorithms readily extend to subset
selection in generalized LMMs via a penalized quasi-likelihood approximation.
On the statistical front, we provide a finite-sample bound on the
Kullback-Leibler divergence of the new method. We then demonstrate its
excellent performance in synthetic experiments and illustrate its utility on

Conclusion: 本文为IRLS在鲁棒子空间恢复和非凸Riemannian流形上的应用提供了首个全局收敛理论。

Abstract: Robust subspace estimation is fundamental to many machine learning and data
analysis tasks. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an elegant and
empirically effective approach to this problem, yet its theoretical properties
remain poorly understood. This paper establishes that, under deterministic
conditions, a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization converges
linearly to the underlying subspace from any initialization. We extend these
guarantees to affine subspace estimation, a setting that lacks prior recovery
theory. Additionally, we illustrate the practical benefits of IRLS through an
application to low-dimensional neural network training. Our results provide the
first global convergence guarantees for IRLS in robust subspace recovery and,
more broadly, for nonconvex IRLS on a Riemannian manifold.

*Kristian Minchev,Dimitar Iliev Dimitrov,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种学习者无关的鲁棒数据预过滤方法（LARP），旨在通过最小化预设学习者集合的最坏情况损失来保护下游学习免受低质量数据影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共数据集中常含有低质量或污染数据，影响学习效果，因此需要开发鲁棒的预过滤方法。

Method: 在Huber数据污染模型下，使用Huber估计器进行标量均值估计，分析多种预过滤方法。

Result: 理论表明，对异构学习者集合进行LARP会导致性能损失，实验验证了这一点。

Conclusion: LARP在大数据集上具有优势，但需权衡效用损失与重复预过滤成本。

Abstract: The widespread availability of large public datasets is a key factor behind
the recent successes of statistical inference and machine learning methods.
However, these datasets often contain some low-quality or contaminated data, to
which many learning procedures are sensitive. Therefore, the question of
whether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate
downstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction
of principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in
the sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners
from corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic
Robust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures
that minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first
instantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber
estimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness
result on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering
procedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a
heterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared
to the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually.
We explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem
parameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data,
observing statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the
trade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific)
prefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP
for large datasets.

### [181] [Finite-Time Information-Theoretic Bounds in Queueing Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18278)
*Yujie Liu,Vincent Y. F. Tan,Yunbei Xu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文首次建立了随机处理网络中调度问题的有限时间信息论下界，并提出新策略实现这些下界，揭示了MaxWeight在有限时间内的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MaxWeight分析仅保证稳定性和在重负载下的渐近最优性，但未解决有限时间内的性能问题。

Method: 提出极小极大框架确定问题参数，推导信息论下界，分析MaxWeight的局限性，并提出新调度规则优化Lyapunov漂移。

Result: 发现MaxWeight在有限时间内可能表现不佳，新策略在特定条件下匹配下界。

Conclusion: 揭示了仅依赖漂移方法的局限性，为非渐近最优队列控制提供了方向。

Abstract: We establish the first finite-time information-theoretic lower bounds-and
derive new policies that achieve them-for the total queue length in scheduling
problems over stochastic processing networks with both adversarial and
stochastic arrivals. Prior analyses of MaxWeight guarantee only stability and
asymptotic optimality in heavy traffic; we prove that, at finite horizons,
MaxWeight can incur strictly larger backlog by problem-dependent factors which
we identify. Our main innovations are 1) a minimax framework that pinpoints the
precise problem parameters governing any policy's finite-time performance; 2)
an information-theoretic lower bound on total queue length; 3) fundamental
limitation of MaxWeight that it is suboptimal in finite time; and 4) a new
scheduling rule that minimizes the full Lyapunov drift-including its
second-order term-thereby matching the lower bound under certain conditions, up
to universal constants. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation on
"drift-only" methods and points the way toward principled, non-asymptotic
optimality in queueing control.

Result: 确定了临界点的分类条件，并解释了梯度方法的收敛行为。

Conclusion: 研究为DMF的优化提供了理论基础，并支持了梯度方法的有效性。

Abstract: Despite its wide range of applications across various domains, the
optimization foundations of deep matrix factorization (DMF) remain largely
open. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive study
of the loss landscape of the regularized DMF problem. Toward this goal, we
first provide a closed-form expression of all critical points. Building on
this, we establish precise conditions under which a critical point is a local
minimizer, a global minimizer, a strict saddle point, or a non-strict saddle
point. Leveraging these results, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition
under which each critical point is either a local minimizer or a strict saddle
point. This provides insights into why gradient-based methods almost always
converge to a local minimizer of the regularized DMF problem. Finally, we
conduct numerical experiments to visualize its loss landscape under different
settings to support our theory.

### [183] [First-order methods for stochastic and finite-sum convex optimization with deterministic constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20630)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of stochastic and finite-sum convex
optimization problems with deterministic constraints. Existing methods
typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-$expectedly\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$
solution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality
gap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$. However, in many
practical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty,
rendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial
violations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods
for finding an $\epsilon$-$surely\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$
($\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically
bounded by $\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\epsilon$.
Our methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified
variance-reduced ASG scheme $only\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty
subproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish
first-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an
$\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle
complexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an
$\epsilon$-SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our
proposed methods to solve the sample average problem.

*Adam Foster,Zeno Schätzle,P. Bernát Szabó,Lixue Cheng,Jonas Köhler,Gino Cassella,Nicholas Gao,Jiawei Li,Frank Noé,Jan Hermann*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Orbformer是一种基于深度QMC的可转移波函数模型，通过预训练在22,000个结构上，能够以低成本实现化学精度（1 kcal/mol）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量子化学中键断裂的多参考性问题，并降低传统多参考方法的高计算成本。

Method: 使用深度神经网络和量子蒙特卡洛（deep QMC）预训练可转移的波函数模型Orbformer。

Result: 在键断裂和Diels-Alder反应中，Orbformer是唯一能稳定达到化学精度的方法。

Conclusion: Orbformer为量子化学提供了一种实用且高效的新范式，能够分摊薛定谔方程的计算成本。

Abstract: Reliable description of bond breaking remains a major challenge for quantum
chemistry due to the multireferential character of the electronic structure in
dissociating species. Multireferential methods in particular suffer from large
computational cost, which under the normal paradigm has to be paid anew for
each system at a full price, ignoring commonalities in electronic structure
across molecules. Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC)
uniquely offers to exploit such commonalities by pretraining transferable
wavefunction models, but all such attempts were so far limited in scope. Here,
we bring this new paradigm to fruition with Orbformer, a novel transferable
wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 equilibrium and dissociating structures
that can be fine-tuned on unseen molecules reaching an accuracy-cost ratio
rivalling classical multireferential methods. On established benchmarks as well
as more challenging bond dissociations and Diels-Alder reactions, Orbformer is
the only method that consistently converges to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol).
This work turns the idea of amortizing the cost of solving the Schr\"odinger
equation over many molecules into a practical approach in quantum chemistry.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可解释的表面视觉变换器（X-SiT），用于基于可解释的皮层特征进行分类，并在阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆检测中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D体积数据难以可视化和解释，而皮层表面渲染提供了更易理解的脑部解剖表示。X-SiT旨在利用这一优势，提供可解释的神经网络预测。

Method: X-SiT结合了原型表面补丁解码器，通过空间对应的皮层原型进行分类，实现了基于案例的推理。

Result: X-SiT在阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆检测中达到最先进性能，并提供了与已知疾病模式一致的原型。

Conclusion: X-SiT不仅性能优越，还能提供可解释的预测，有助于临床决策支持。

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making,
driving advances in their development and application for medical images.
However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to
visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral
cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more
accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating
visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the
widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present
the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first
inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable
predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we
introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch
embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding
cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in
detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally
providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and
reveal classification errors.

TL;DR: PocketVina是一种快速、内存高效的分子对接框架，结合口袋预测与多口袋探索，在物理有效对接姿态采样中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子对接中未见或结构多样目标的物理有效姿态采样难题。

Method: 结合口袋预测与系统性多口袋探索的搜索框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在物理有效性（PB-valid）和RMSD联合指标上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: PocketVina提供了一种无需任务特定训练的高效对接策略，适用于高通量虚拟筛选。

Abstract: Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in
molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We
introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking
framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket
exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established
benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and
PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically
valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when
jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while
remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD
alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets.
PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy
across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce
TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000
protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem
activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully
discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning
baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina
offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific
training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for
high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.

Conclusion: 该框架灵活且可扩展，适用于快速GPR地下成像，如土木工程、环境监测和地球物理勘探。

Abstract: This study proposes a high-performance dual-parameter full waveform inversion
framework (FWI) for ground-penetrating radar (GPR), accelerated through the
hybrid compilation of CUDA kernel functions and PyTorch. The method leverages
the computational efficiency of GPU programming while preserving the
flexibility and usability of Python-based deep learning frameworks. By
integrating customized CUDA kernels into PyTorch's automatic differentiation
mechanism, the framework enables accurate and efficient inversion of both
dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity. Experimental evaluations
on synthetic data and real wavefield data demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves dual-parameter FWI for GPR data while maintaining high accuracy.
Moreover, the framework is flexible and extensible, supporting optional
regularization strategies such as total variation and multi-scale inversion.
These features make the proposed approach a practical and scalable framework
for rapid GPR-based subsurface imaging in applications including civil
engineering, environmental monitoring, and geophysical exploration.

Motivation: 研究通用压缩中序列模式（反向适应）的探索与利用权衡，解决现有方法的鲁棒性和短块性能问题。

Method: 将序列模式重新建模为多臂老虎机问题，提出并分析鲁棒的成本导向算法。

Result: 证明了现有方法的局限性，并提出适用于任意块长度的鲁棒算法。

Conclusion: 成本导向的多臂老虎机算法在通用压缩中表现更优，解决了鲁棒性和短块性能问题。

Abstract: Universal compression can learn the source and adapt to it either in a batch
mode (forward adaptation), or in a sequential mode (backward adaptation). We
recast the sequential mode as a multi-armed bandit problem, a fundamental model
in reinforcement-learning, and study the trade-off between exploration and
exploitation in the lossy compression case. We show that a previously proposed
"natural type selection" scheme can be cast as a reconstruction-directed MAB
algorithm, for sequential lossy compression, and explain its limitations in
terms of robustness and short-block performance. We then derive and analyze
robust cost-directed MAB algorithms, which work at any block length.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A growing trend in the database and system communities is to augment
conventional index structures, such as B+-trees, with machine learning (ML)
models. Among these, error-bounded Piecewise Linear Approximation
($\epsilon$-PLA) has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and
effectiveness. Despite its central role in many learned indexes, the design and
analysis of $\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms remain underexplored. In this
paper, we revisit $\epsilon$-PLA from both theoretical and empirical
perspectives, with a focus on its application in learned index structures. We
first establish a fundamentally improved lower bound of $\Omega(\kappa \cdot
\epsilon^2)$ on the expected segment coverage for existing $\epsilon$-PLA
fitting algorithms, where $\kappa$ is a data-dependent constant. We then
present a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-PLA algorithms
when used in different learned data structures. Our results highlight key
trade-offs among model accuracy, model size, and query performance, providing
actionable guidelines for the principled design of future learned data
structures.

Abstract: The explosive growth of AI research has driven paper submissions at flagship
AI conferences to unprecedented levels, necessitating many venues in 2025
(e.g., CVPR, ICCV, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, WSDM) to enforce strict per-author
submission limits and to desk-reject any excess papers by simple ID order.
While this policy helps reduce reviewer workload, it may unintentionally
discard valuable papers and penalize authors' efforts. In this paper, we ask an
essential research question on whether it is possible to follow submission
limits while minimizing needless rejections. We first formalize the current
desk-rejection policies as an optimization problem, and then develop a
practical algorithm based on linear programming relaxation and a rounding
scheme. Under extensive evaluation on 11 years of real-world ICLR
(International Conference on Learning Representations) data, our method
preserves up to $19.23\%$ more papers without violating any author limits.
Moreover, our algorithm is highly efficient in practice, with all results on
ICLR data computed within at most 53.64 seconds. Our work provides a simple and
practical desk-rejection strategy that significantly reduces unnecessary
rejections, demonstrating strong potential to improve current CS conference
submission policies.

Method: 两阶段深度学习管道：第一阶段监督训练MLC和MU值；第二阶段加入预测3D剂量分布的物理引导。使用3D U-Net和UNETR架构。

Result: 在133名前列腺癌患者中，方法生成的计划接近临床标准，PTV的D95%和V95%差异小，且减少危险器官的辐射暴露。

Conclusion: 物理引导的深度学习在放射治疗计划中具有潜力，能高效生成高质量计划。

Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, with volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) being a commonly used technique that enhances dose
conformity by dynamically adjusting multileaf collimator (MLC) positions and
monitor units (MU) throughout gantry rotation. Adaptive radiotherapy requires
frequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations,
necessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising
solution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage,
physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first
stage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan
parameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we
incorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose
distribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We
train and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a
uniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target
volume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented
using both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment
plans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean
difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV
while generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at
risk. These findings highlight the potential of physics-guided deep learning in
RT planning.

Conclusion: 该方法为皮肤粘合剂系统的设计和优化提供了高效、可靠的预测工具，推动了计算皮肤力学和生物粘合剂材料研究的发展。

Abstract: Studying the peeling behaviour of adhesives on skin is vital for advancing
biomedical applications such as medical adhesives and transdermal patches.
Traditional methods like experimental testing and finite element method (FEM),
though considered gold standards, are resource-intensive, computationally
expensive and time-consuming, particularly when analysing a wide material
parameter space. In this study, we present a neural network-based approach to
predict the minimum peel force (F_min) required for adhesive detachment from
skin tissue, limiting the need for repeated FEM simulations and significantly
reducing the computational cost. Leveraging a dataset generated from FEM
simulations of 90 degree peel test with varying adhesive and fracture mechanics
parameters, our neural network model achieved high accuracy, validated through
rigorous 5-fold cross-validation. The final architecture was able to predict a
wide variety of skin-adhesive peeling behaviour, exhibiting a mean squared
error (MSE) of 3.66*10^-7 and a R^2 score of 0.94 on test set, demonstrating
robust performance. This work introduces a reliable, computationally efficient
method for predicting adhesive behaviour, significantly reducing simulation
time while maintaining accuracy. This integration of machine learning with
high-fidelity biomechanical simulations enables efficient design and
optimization of skin-adhesive systems, providing a scalable framework for
future research in computational dermato-mechanics and bio-adhesive material
design.

Motivation: 解决腹腔镜与开放手术在结肠癌患者中的生存结果比较时的选择偏倚问题。

Method: 使用QNN模型，结合CMA-ES优化和噪声抑制策略，对77个变量中的4个关键协变量进行倾向得分估计。

Result: QNN在小样本中表现优于经典方法（AUC达0.750），倾向得分匹配后生存分析未显示显著差异。

Conclusion: QNN结合CMA-ES和噪声抑制策略，在生物医学小样本高维数据中有潜力提升因果推断能力。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for
propensity score estimation to address selection bias in comparing survival
outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgical techniques in a cohort of 1177
colorectal carcinoma patients treated at University Hospital Ostrava
(2001-2009). Using a dataset with 77 variables, including patient demographics
and tumor characteristics, we developed QNN-based propensity score models
focusing on four key covariates (Age, Sex, Stage, BMI). The QNN architecture
employed a linear ZFeatureMap for data encoding, a SummedPaulis operator for
predictions, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
for robust, gradient-free optimization in noisy quantum environments. Variance
regularization was integrated to mitigate quantum measurement noise, with
simulations conducted under exact, sampling (1024 shots), and noisy hardware
(FakeManhattanV2) conditions. QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise,
outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in
small samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing
predictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via
genetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with
standardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively. Survival
analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards, and Aalen
additive regression revealed no significant survival differences
post-adjustment (p-values 0.287-0.851), indicating confounding bias in
unadjusted outcomes. These results highlight QNNs' potential, enhanced by
CMA-ES and noise-aware strategies, to improve causal inference in biomedical
research, particularly for small-sample, high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: Technological advances in the past decades have begun to enable
neuroscientists to address fundamental questions about consciousness in an
unprecedented way. Here we review remarkable recent progress in our
understanding of cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the
brain. Of particular interest are the cortical pyramidal neurons -- or "psychic
cells" called by Ram\'on y Cajal more than 100 years ago -- which have an
intriguing cellular mechanism that accounts for selective disruption of
feedback signaling in the brain upon anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness.
Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the
dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism.
After all, Cajal's instinct over a century ago may turn out to be correct -- we
may have just begun to understand whether and how psychic cells indeed generate
and control our consciousness.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MNN-AECS的系统，通过动态选择低功耗CPU核心来优化设备上大型语言模型（LLM）解码阶段的能效，显著降低了能耗且不影响解码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着设备上LLM推理需求的增长，能效成为关键问题，尤其是电池有限的移动设备。现有工作多关注预填充阶段的加速，而忽略了解码阶段的能耗问题。

Method: 提出Adaptive Energy-Centric Core Selection（AECS）方法，并将其集成到MNN中，形成MNN-AECS系统，动态选择低功耗CPU核心以减少能耗。

Result: 在5种Android和2种iOS设备上测试5种不同规模的LLM，MNN-AECS平均降低23%的能耗且不影响速度。与其他引擎相比，能耗节省39%-78%，速度提升12%-363%。

Conclusion: MNN-AECS是首个无需root或OS修改的引擎级系统解决方案，显著提升了LLM解码的能效。

Abstract: As the demand for on-device Large Language Model (LLM) inference grows,
energy efficiency has become a major concern, especially for battery-limited
mobile devices. Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase
dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the
prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric
Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient
version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring
root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is
designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an
acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores.
MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of
various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23%
without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other
engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS
delivers 39% to 78% energy saving and 12% to 363% speedup on average.

Conclusion: FundaQ-8提升了深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变分级中的稳健性，凸显了质量感知训练的价值。

Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to
variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce
FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing
fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage,
anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a
structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to
predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on
1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using
transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized
preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses
confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability.
Incorporating FundaQ-8 into deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy
grading also improves diagnostic robustness, highlighting the value of
quality-aware training in real-world screening applications.

TL;DR: VoxelOpt 是一种基于离散优化的图像配准框架，结合了学习和迭代方法的优点，在精度和速度之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型方法在数据有限或大变形时表现不佳，而迭代方法虽准确但速度慢。VoxelOpt 旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 使用位移熵衡量信号强度，引入体素自适应消息传递、多级图像金字塔和预训练分割模型提取特征。

Result: 在腹部 CT 配准中，VoxelOpt 在效率和精度上优于迭代方法，并与监督学习型方法相当。

Conclusion: VoxelOpt 提供了一种高效且准确的图像配准解决方案，结合了学习和迭代方法的优势。

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image
registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and
accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges
with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform
compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While
iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are
considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,
we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines
the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better
balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement
entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each
voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it
introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy
receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level
image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential
complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive
learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature
extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to
outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching
state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The
source code will be available at https://github.com/tinymilky/VoxelOpt

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为WMF的新特征，用于改善4D Flow MRI图像的分割效果，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI图像分辨率低且噪声多，影响生物标志物（如壁剪切应力）的准确性，现有PC-MRA方法仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出WMF特征，通过加权平均频率揭示脉动流区域，并采用最优阈值和深度学习方法进行分割实验。

Result: WMF特征显著提升了分割性能（IoU和Dice分别提高0.12和0.13），优于PC-MRA。

Conclusion: WMF特征有望为其他血管区域（如心脏或大脑）的分割提供新思路。

Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the
quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the
cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in
these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it
appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by
the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate
segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft
feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is
useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies
(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has
been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the
hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under
discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved
segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning
methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of
IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with
the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has
the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation
processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer trading and the move to decentralized grids have reshaped the
energy markets in the United States. Notwithstanding, such developments lead to
new challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade.
This study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient
energy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research
interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence
(AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy
market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and
market reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2
million anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer
(P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American
microgrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record
contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume
(kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier
(hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement
confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior
metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical
pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of
two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer,
each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing
and market intelligence improvement. The machine learning models used in this
research were specifically chosen for their established high performance in
classification tasks, specifically in the identification of energy transaction
fraud in decentralized markets.

Abstract: Insurance fraud detection represents a pivotal advancement in modern
insurance service, providing intelligent and digitalized monitoring to enhance
management and prevent fraud. It is crucial for ensuring the security and
efficiency of insurance systems. Although AI and machine learning algorithms
have demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent claims, the
absence of standardized defense mechanisms renders current systems vulnerable
to emerging adversarial threats. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach
to conduct adversarial attacks on fraud detection systems. Our results indicate
that an attacker, without knowledge of the training data or internal model
details, can generate fraudulent cases that are classified as legitimate with a
99\% attack success rate (ASR). By subtly modifying real insurance records and
claims, adversaries can significantly increase the fraud risk, potentially
bypassing compromised detection systems. These findings underscore the urgent
need to enhance the robustness of insurance fraud detection models against
adversarial manipulation, thereby ensuring the stability and reliability of
different insurance systems.

Motivation: 现有安全权重发布方案缺乏严格的安全基础，仅提供非正式的安全保证，需要更严谨的研究。

Result: 分析发现TaylorMLP存在参数提取漏洞，未能实现其安全目标。

Conclusion: 呼吁在机器学习和安全领域的交叉研究中采用更严谨的方法，为未来权重发布方案的设计和评估提供蓝图。

Abstract: Recent secure weight release schemes claim to enable open-source model
distribution while protecting model ownership and preventing misuse. However,
these approaches lack rigorous security foundations and provide only informal
security guarantees. Inspired by established works in cryptography, we
formalize the security of weight release schemes by introducing several
concrete security definitions. We then demonstrate our definition's utility
through a case study of TaylorMLP, a prominent secure weight release scheme.
Our analysis reveals vulnerabilities that allow parameter extraction thus
showing that TaylorMLP fails to achieve its informal security goals. We hope
this work will advocate for rigorous research at the intersection of machine
learning and security communities and provide a blueprint for how future weight
release schemes should be designed and evaluated.

Motivation: 寻找适合入侵检测的机器学习范式，以构建有效且通用的安全解决方案。

Method: 在CICIDS2017数据集上对比了MLP、1D CNN、OCSVM和LOF四种模型，分为已知攻击和未知攻击两种场景。

Result: 监督模型（MLP和CNN）在已知攻击上表现优异，但对未知攻击召回率低；无监督模型（LOF）对未知攻击召回率高但误报率高；OCSVM在精度和召回率之间平衡最佳。

Conclusion: OCSVM在两种场景下表现稳健，为动态网络环境中的入侵检测模型选择提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Identifying suitable machine learning paradigms for intrusion detection
remains critical for building effective and generalizable security solutions.
In this study, we present a controlled comparison of four representative models
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on
the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and
generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP
and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic
recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall
accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false
alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best,
demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting IDS models in dynamic network environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力引发了隐私侵犯攻击（PVA），现有防御方法成本高且效果不佳，直接拒绝攻击查询会暴露防御方法。

Method: 设计改写提示诱导LLM重写攻击查询的“用户评论”以构建干扰数据库，采用最不相关检索策略检索用户数据，替换“数据评论”形成防御查询。

Result: 在两个数据集和八个流行LLM上的实验验证了该防御方法的可行性和优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的RCG方法能有效隐蔽地防御PVA，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact
on our society and also raised new security concerns. Particularly, due to the
remarkable inference ability of LLMs, the privacy violation attack (PVA),
revealed by Staab et al., introduces serious personal privacy issues. Existing
defense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which
requires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense
performance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective
defense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of
PVA. In this paper, we propose a novel defense paradigm based on
retrieval-confused generation (RCG) of LLMs, which can efficiently and covertly
defend the PVA. We first design a paraphrasing prompt to induce the LLM to
rewrite the "user comments" of the attack query to construct a disturbed
database. Then, we propose the most irrelevant retrieval strategy to retrieve
the desired user data from the disturbed database. Finally, the "data comments"
are replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to
responding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the
attack fails. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets and eight
popular LLMs to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility and the superiority of
the proposed defense method.

TL;DR: RepuNet是一种去中心化声誉系统，用于检测和缓解DFL中的恶意行为，通过动态评估节点行为并调整其影响力，实验表明其在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFL中节点的自主性引入了新的安全漏洞（如模型投毒、延迟攻击等），现有解决方案依赖刚性配置或额外基础设施，导致计算开销或适应性不足。

Method: 提出RepuNet，通过模型相似性、参数变化、消息延迟和通信量等指标动态评估节点行为，并根据声誉分数调整节点在模型聚合中的影响力。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，RepuNet的F1分数分别超过95%和约76%，有效检测和缓解恶意行为。

Conclusion: RepuNet具有适应性、鲁棒性和实际潜力，适用于去中心化联邦学习环境中的威胁缓解。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train
models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each
node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may
exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying
model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive
messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often
depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as
blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a
decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically
evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes,
message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model
aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was
integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to
25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack
intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results
demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior,
achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for
CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness,
and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated
learning environments.

Motivation: 探讨生成模型输出是否可能侵犯训练数据版权的条件，解决Vyaset al.提出的“可证明版权保护”问题。

Method: 分析NAF的局限性，提出无责复制保护框架和清洁室复制保护概念，并证明DP在满足特定条件时能提供版权保护。

Result: NAF无法防止侵权，清洁室复制保护能有效控制复制风险，DP在数据集满足去重要求时可实现版权保护。

Conclusion: 本文为版权保护提供了更坚实的技术和法律基础，明确了DP在版权保护中的作用。

Abstract: Are there any conditions under which a generative model's outputs are
guaranteed not to infringe the copyrights of its training data? This is the
question of "provable copyright protection" first posed by Vyas, Kakade, and
Barak (ICML 2023). They define near access-freeness (NAF) and propose it as
sufficient for protection. This paper revisits the question and establishes new
foundations for provable copyright protection -- foundations that are firmer
both technically and legally. First, we show that NAF alone does not prevent
infringement. In fact, NAF models can enable verbatim copying, a blatant
failure of copy protection that we dub being tainted. Then, we introduce our
blameless copy protection framework for defining meaningful guarantees, and
instantiate it with clean-room copy protection. Clean-room copy protection
allows a user to control their risk of copying by behaving in a way that is
unlikely to copy in a counterfactual clean-room setting. Finally, we formalize
a common intuition about differential privacy and copyright by proving that DP
implies clean-room copy protection when the dataset is golden, a copyright
deduplication requirement.

Conclusion: DiffSem有效提升了任务性能与系统鲁棒性，同时揭示了传统图像质量指标与语义信息泄漏之间的显著偏差。

Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising neural network-based system
design for 6G networks. Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel
paradigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by
transmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task
performance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining
task accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In
such attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by
analyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based
nature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality
indicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be
inadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences
do not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a
diffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes
semantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with
self-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our
model also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion
to ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio
environments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric
that better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary.
Experimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset,
DiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable
performance under dynamic channels. Our results further demonstrate that
significant deviation exists between traditional image quality indicators and
the leakage of task-relevant semantic information.

Abstract: We propose Guardian-FC, a novel two-layer framework for privacy preserving
federated computing that unifies safety enforcement across diverse privacy
preserving mechanisms, including cryptographic back-ends like fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE) and multiparty computation (MPC), as well as statistical
techniques such as differential privacy (DP). Guardian-FC decouples guard-rails
from privacy mechanisms by executing plug-ins (modular computation units),
written in a backend-neutral, domain-specific language (DSL) designed
specifically for federated computing workflows and interchangeable Execution
Providers (EPs), which implement DSL operations for various privacy back-ends.
An Agentic-AI control plane enforces a finite-state safety loop through signed
telemetry and commands, ensuring consistent risk management and auditability.
The manifest-centric design supports fail-fast job admission and seamless
extensibility to new privacy back-ends. We present qualitative scenarios
illustrating backend-agnostic safety and a formal model foundation for
verification. Finally, we outline a research agenda inviting the community to
advance adaptive guard-rail tuning, multi-backend composition, DSL
specification development, implementation, and compiler extensibility alongside
human-override usability.

monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent
systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more
effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel
multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security
verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification
question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan
and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug
validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in
these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as
in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The
system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate
security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks
early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware
security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that
showcase its applicability and efficacy.

### [209] [Attack Smarter: Attention-Driven Fine-Grained Webpage Fingerprinting Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20082)
*Yali Yuan,Weiyi Zou,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力的细粒度网页指纹攻击方法（ADWPF），用于大规模环境中识别用户访问的子页面，解决了多标签浏览和重叠流量段的分类难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网站指纹攻击（WF）主要局限于小规模场景，仅能识别主页，而实际用户常快速访问多个子页面，导致流量特征重叠，分类困难。

Method: ADWPF通过注意力驱动的方法，在训练阶段对流量显著区域进行增强（如注意力裁剪和掩码），提取低维特征，并利用自注意力模块捕捉全局上下文模式。针对多标签场景，使用残差注意力生成不同时间位置的类特定表示。

Result: 实验表明，ADWPF在不同规模的数据集上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADWPF有效解决了大规模环境中网页指纹攻击的挑战，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks aim to infer which websites a user is
visiting by analyzing traffic patterns, thereby compromising user anonymity.
Although this technique has been demonstrated to be effective in controlled
experimental environments, it remains largely limited to small-scale scenarios,
typically restricted to recognizing website homepages. In practical settings,
however, users frequently access multiple subpages in rapid succession, often
before previous content fully loads. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) generalizes
the WF framework to large-scale environments by modeling subpages of the same
site as distinct classes. These pages often share similar page elements,
resulting in lower inter-class variance in traffic features. Furthermore, we
consider multi-tab browsing scenarios, in which a single trace encompasses
multiple categories of webpages. This leads to overlapping traffic segments,
and similar features may appear in different positions within the traffic,
thereby increasing the difficulty of classification. To address these
challenges, we propose an attention-driven fine-grained WPF attack, named
ADWPF. Specifically, during the training phase, we apply targeted augmentation
to salient regions of the traffic based on attention maps, including attention
cropping and attention masking. ADWPF then extracts low-dimensional features
from both the original and augmented traffic and applies self-attention modules
to capture the global contextual patterns of the trace. Finally, to handle the
multi-tab scenario, we employ the residual attention to generate class-specific
representations of webpages occurring at different temporal positions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across datasets of different scales.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出ARC框架，通过自主闭环强化过程实现分析韧性，利用红蓝代理的协同进化动态提升关键基础设施的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IT与OT融合导致关键基础设施面临新型智能攻击，现有静态防御失效，需解决信任三要素（系统模型保真度、数据同步完整性、分析引擎韧性）。

Method: 引入ARC框架，包含红代理（DRL智能体）自主发现隐蔽攻击路径，蓝代理（集成防御体）通过对抗训练持续强化，形成协同进化动态。

Result: 在TEP和SWaT测试平台上验证ARC框架性能优越，协同进化显著提升新型攻击检测能力。

Conclusion: ARC框架是动态自改进安全范式的必要转变，结合XAI确保操作者信任，F-ARC架构可扩展。

Abstract: The convergence of IT and OT has created hyper-connected ICS, exposing
critical infrastructure to a new class of adaptive, intelligent adversaries
that render static defenses obsolete. Existing security paradigms often fail to
address a foundational "Trinity of Trust," comprising the fidelity of the
system model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the
analytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC
framework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous,
closed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms
race within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the "Red
Agent," is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,
physically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while
evading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based "Blue Agent" defender is
continuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats
discovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to
become progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously
probe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the
TEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A
comprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including
ROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is
responsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks.
By integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC
architecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a
necessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future
of critical infrastructure.

*Sabrine Ennaji,Elhadj Benkhelifa,Luigi V. Mancini*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的黑盒对抗攻击方法，通过自适应特征选择和因果分析，减少交互并提高实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在结构化数据（如网络流量）中效果有限，且缺乏可重复性。现有防御难以应对不断演变的攻击。

Method: 采用基于变化点检测和因果分析的自适应特征选择策略，严格遵循黑盒约束，减少交互。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效规避检测，计算成本低，适用于实际场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为网络流量中的对抗攻击研究提供了新思路，有助于开发更鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks, wherein slight inputs are carefully crafted to mislead
intelligent models, have attracted increasing attention. However, a critical
gap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application,
particularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent
features complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in
current approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field.
Hence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that
addresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system
access or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box
constraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect
real-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using
change-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive
features to perturbations. This lightweight design ensures low computational
cost and high deployability. Our comprehensive experiments show the attack's
effectiveness in evading detection with minimal interaction, enhancing its
adaptability and applicability in real-world scenarios. By advancing the
understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, this work lays a
foundation for developing robust defenses.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习（RL）的动态闭环控制方法，通过高精度大涡模拟（LES）优化风电场功率输出，相比传统静态控制方法显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风电场控制方法独立优化单台涡轮机，忽略了尾流协同效应和湍流动态，限制了整体功率输出。

Method: 结合强化学习与高精度大涡模拟，实现动态闭环控制，实时响应大气湍流。

Result: RL控制器使风电场功率输出提升4.30%，优于静态最优偏航控制的2.19%增益。

Conclusion: 动态流响应控制是风电场优化的革命性方法，对加速可再生能源部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Traditional wind farm control operates each turbine independently to maximize
individual power output. However, coordinated wake steering across the entire
farm can substantially increase the combined wind farm energy production.
Although dynamic closed-loop control has proven effective in flow control
applications, wind farm optimization has relied primarily on static,
low-fidelity simulators that ignore critical turbulent flow dynamics. In this
work, we present the first reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated
directly with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES), enabling real-time
response to atmospheric turbulence through collaborative, dynamic control
strategies. Our RL controller achieves a 4.30% increase in wind farm power
output compared to baseline operation, nearly doubling the 2.19% gain from
static optimal yaw control obtained through Bayesian optimization. These
results establish dynamic flow-responsive control as a transformative approach
to wind farm optimization, with direct implications for accelerating renewable
energy deployment to net-zero targets.

Conclusion: 该框架为双边团队形成提供了新视角，展示了算法特性对性能和泛化的重要性。

Abstract: Team formation and the dynamics of team-based learning have drawn significant
interest in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However,
existing studies primarily focus on unilateral groupings, predefined teams, or
fixed-population settings, leaving the effects of algorithmic bilateral
grouping choices in dynamic populations underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic
multi-agent systems. Through this study, we gain insight into what algorithmic
properties in bilateral team formation influence policy performance and
generalization. We validate our approach using widely adopted multi-agent
scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and improved generalization in
most scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统说话人跟踪方法依赖空间观测，但在间歇性和移动说话人场景中表现不佳，导致轨迹不连续。

Method: 利用初始跟踪步骤提供的轨迹信息和多通道音频信号，通过波束成形增强信号并提取说话人嵌入，基于注册池重新分配身份。

Conclusion: 基于说话人嵌入的身份重新分配方法有效解决了间歇性和移动说话人跟踪问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Speaker tracking methods often rely on spatial observations to assign
coherent track identities over time. This raises limits in scenarios with
intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when
they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This
paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple
solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment
post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related
information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal.
Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in
order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track
identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset
where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it
consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and
standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming
and input duration for embedding extraction.

Abstract: This paper presents our contributions to the Speech Emotion Recognition in
Naturalistic Conditions (SERNC) Challenge, where we address categorical emotion
recognition and emotional attribute prediction. To handle the complexities of
natural speech, including intra- and inter-subject variability, we propose
Multi-level Acoustic-Textual Emotion Representation (MATER), a novel
hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and textual features at the
word, utterance, and embedding levels. By fusing low-level lexical and acoustic
cues with high-level contextualized representations, MATER effectively captures
both fine-grained prosodic variations and semantic nuances. Additionally, we
introduce an uncertainty-aware ensemble strategy to mitigate annotator
inconsistencies, improving robustness in ambiguous emotional expressions. MATER
ranks fourth in both tasks with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of
0.5928, securing second place in valence prediction with an impressive CCC of
0.6941.

Motivation: 云计算的高能耗和碳排放问题日益严重，亟需高效透明的解决方案，尤其是针对占87%组织使用的私有云基础设施。

Method: MAIZX框架利用实时和预测的碳强度、PUE和能耗数据，通过灵活排名算法动态优化资源。

Result: 在分布式数据中心测试中，MAIZX实现了85.68%的CO2减排，并展示了可扩展性和有效性。

Conclusion: MAIZX为提升气候性能潜力同时保持运营效率提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Cloud computing drives innovation but also poses significant environmental
challenges due to its high-energy consumption and carbon emissions. Data
centers account for 2-4% of global energy usage, and the ICT sector's share of
electricity consumption is projected to reach 40% by 2040. As the goal of
achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 becomes increasingly urgent, there is a
growing need for more efficient and transparent solutions, particularly for
private cloud infrastructures, which are utilized by 87% of organizations,
despite the dominance of public-cloud systems.
  This study evaluates the MAIZX framework, designed to optimize cloud
operations and reduce carbon footprint by dynamically ranking resources,
including data centers, edge computing nodes, and multi-cloud environments,
based on real-time and forecasted carbon intensity, Power Usage Effectiveness
(PUE), and energy consumption. Leveraging a flexible ranking algorithm, MAIZX
achieved an 85.68% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to baseline hypervisor
operations. Tested across geographically distributed data centers, the
framework demonstrates scalability and effectiveness, directly interfacing with
hypervisors to optimize workloads in private, hybrid, and multi-cloud
environments. MAIZX integrates real-time data on carbon intensity, power
consumption, and carbon footprint, as well as forecasted values, into cloud
management, providing a robust tool for enhancing climate performance potential
while maintaining operational efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has
raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions
associated with model training and inference. However, existing tools for
measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic
metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among
them. This paper presents WattsOnAI, a comprehensive software toolkit for the
measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware
performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly
integrating with existing AI frameworks, WattsOnAI offers standardized reports
and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and
reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth
correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus
facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By
addressing critical limitations in existing tools, WattsOnAI encourages the
research community to weigh environmental impact alongside raw performance of
AI workloads and advances the shift toward more sustainable "Green AI"
practices. The code is available at https://github.com/SusCom-Lab/WattsOnAI.

Conclusion: DualEquiNet通过双空间表示和层次化建模，为大型生物分子系统提供了一种高效且表达能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have
achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face
scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules
such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously
capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across
spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure,
such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains.
Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either
Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture
both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware
dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large
biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant
Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and
Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware
features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a
novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate
atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling
efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.
DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing
benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms
prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating
its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.

Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design
by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined
reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core
challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2)
scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small
fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy
framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate
synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost
synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular
diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation
Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To
enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a
\textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states
to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art
results in template-based molecular generation.

Abstract: The escalating rates of gun-related violence and mass shootings represent a
significant threat to public safety. Timely and accurate information for law
enforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current
commercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with
prohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by
leveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from
ubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also
classify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering
gun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate
the fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts
and shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting
direction. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type
classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a
mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the
SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental
noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data
(mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly
accurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices,
significantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to
first responders.
