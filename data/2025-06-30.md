TL;DR: 论文提出了SEEA-R1框架，通过Tree-GRPO和MGRM解决强化微调在具身智能中的奖励稀疏和泛化问题，在ALFWorld基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化微调（RFT）在具身智能中的自进化能力尚未充分探索，面临奖励稀疏和泛化受限的挑战。

Method: 提出SEEA-R1框架，结合Tree-GRPO（基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的GRPO）和MGRM（多模态生成奖励模型）。

Result: 在ALFWorld测试中，SEEA-R1以85.07%（文本）和36.19%（多模态）超越现有方法，包括GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SEEA-R1展示了具身智能自进化的潜力，为未来研究提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning
and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon,
real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential
to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions
remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two
fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible
intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning
signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts
generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we
present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework
designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.
Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate
signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative
policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into
GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting
autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce
Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the
effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%
(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also
achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all
open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving
embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support
the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

*Guan Wang,Jin Li,Yuhao Sun,Xing Chen,Changling Liu,Yue Wu,Meng Lu,Sen Song,Yasin Abbasi Yadkori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HRM是一种新型递归架构，通过分层和多时间尺度处理，显著提升推理任务的效率和性能，无需预训练或大量数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的Chain-of-Thought技术存在任务分解脆弱、数据需求高和延迟大的问题，HRM受人类大脑启发，旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: HRM采用两个相互依赖的递归模块：高层模块负责抽象规划，低层模块处理细节计算，单次前向传递完成推理任务。

Result: HRM仅需2700万参数和1000个训练样本，在复杂推理任务（如数独和迷宫路径规划）上表现优异，并在ARC基准上超越更大模型。

Conclusion: HRM展示了通用计算和通用推理系统的潜力，是迈向人工通用智能的重要进展。

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action
sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models
(LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from
brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency.
Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,
we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent
architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining
both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks
in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate
process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module
responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid,
detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training
samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves
nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku
puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms
much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction
and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general
intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a
transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose
reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THE-Tree框架通过构建科学领域演化树，结合LLM和验证机制，显著提升科学发展的预测和评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证方法（如LLM独立验证或传统引用网络）无法有效评估AI生成的科学命题的新颖性和准确性，需要一种结构化、可验证的科学发展历史数据框架。

Method: 提出THE-Tree框架，通过搜索算法构建领域演化树，结合LLM的“Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify”流程和自然语言推理机制验证每一步的逻辑和证据支持。

Result: 在88个领域的实验中，THE-Tree在图形完成、预测科学发展及评估重要论文方面表现优于传统方法，提升幅度达8%至100%。

Conclusion: THE-Tree为解决科学命题验证瓶颈提供了有效工具，显著提升了科学发展的预测和评估能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but
rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated
propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual
verification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as
standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings
show ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while
traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are
unstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,
verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To
address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology
\textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that
constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific
literature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.
During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify"
process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting
literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for
logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language
inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each
step is grounded.We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains
and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering
27k papers to foster further research.Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph
completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8\% to 14\% across multiple models
compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific
developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10\%; and iii) when combined
with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important
scientific papers by almost 100\%.

TL;DR: MobiVerse是一个混合框架，结合轻量级领域特定生成器和LLMs，用于大规模人类移动模式模拟，解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动模拟平台在算法开发、政策实施和大规模评估方面存在不足，传统方法数据需求高且适应性差。

Method: 提出MobiVerse混合框架，结合轻量级生成器生成基础活动链，利用LLMs进行上下文感知调整。

Result: 在洛杉矶Westwood的案例研究中，成功为53,000个代理生成动态调整的日程，响应环境变化。

Conclusion: MobiVerse在计算效率和行为真实性之间取得平衡，为移动系统规划提供了可定制平台。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility patterns is crucial for effective
transportation planning and urban development. Despite significant advances in
mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that
allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive
evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data
collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with
adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale
simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid
framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for
generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware
modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we
efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole
population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments
demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to
environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like
football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular
design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation
system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational
efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in
mobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems
planning and operations with benchmark algorithms. Code and videos are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CitySim利用大型语言模型模拟城市环境中的人类行为，通过递归价值驱动方法生成真实日程，并赋予代理信念、长期目标和空间记忆，实现更接近真实人类的模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖刻板规则，难以模拟复杂意图和适应性行为，CitySim旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用递归价值驱动方法，结合代理的信念、长期目标和空间记忆，生成真实日程。

Result: CitySim在微观和宏观层面均更接近真实人类行为，并能模拟大规模代理的集体行为。

Conclusion: CitySim是一个可扩展、灵活的平台，可用于理解和预测城市现象。

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social
science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on
rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced
intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we
envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in
human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents
generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that
balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To
enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term
goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment
with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and
evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,
including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing
well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for
understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

### [6] [Interactive Multi-Objective Probabilistic Preference Learning with Soft and Hard Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21887)
*Edward Chen,Sang T. Truong,Natalie Dullerud,Sanmi Koyejo,Carlos Guestrin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active-MoSH是一个交互式框架，用于高风险决策中多目标优化，结合软硬边界和偏好学习，提升决策者信任和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险决策中，如近距离放射治疗，需要平衡多个竞争目标（如肿瘤覆盖率和器官剂量限制），但现有方法缺乏系统性迭代优化偏好结构的能力，且决策者需信任最终选择。

Method: Active-MoSH框架包含局部和全局组件：局部组件通过软硬边界和概率偏好学习自适应优化帕累托子集；全局组件T-MoSH通过多目标敏感性分析识别潜在高价值点。

Result: 实验证明Active-MoSH在合成和实际应用中表现优异，用户研究显示其能提升收敛速度、增强决策者信任并提供更丰富的偏好表达。

Conclusion: Active-MoSH通过交互式框架有效支持高风险决策，平衡多目标优化与决策者信任，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives
with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must
balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound
of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard
bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being
resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit
preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is
computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive
frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain
knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often
lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference
structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they
haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in
high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global
framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard
bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over
DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided
by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while
minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,
T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially
overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate
Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world
applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates
our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence,
enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more
effective DMs.

### [7] [AlphaBeta is not as good as you think: a new probabilistic model to better analyze deterministic game-solving algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21996)
*Raphaël Boige,Amine Boumaza,Bruno Scherrer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的概率模型，通过引入祖先依赖关系生成更具挑战性的游戏树，分析了AlphaBeta和Scout等算法的平均复杂度，揭示了实际性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型因独立性假设过于简化，无法反映真实游戏的结构复杂性，限制了算法的实际性能分析。

Method: 提出基于层级条件分布的概率模型，强制祖先依赖关系，生成可调整难度的游戏树，并推导算法的递归复杂度公式。

Result: 在深层游戏树中，AlphaBeta的常数乘因子显著大于Scout，导致实际性能下降。

Conclusion: 新模型为经典游戏求解算法提供了更现实且可分析的研究框架，揭示了算法在实际应用中的性能差异。

Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the
light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random
game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed
distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,
revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse
to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms
achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's
design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural
complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model
that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional
distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature
of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable
difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several
algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas
characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us
to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo
simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem
to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of
independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:
AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared
to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our
framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering
rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these
methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanConjecturer是一个结合规则和LLM的自动生成数学猜想的系统，解决了形式化定理证明中数据稀缺的问题，生成了大量非平凡猜想，并展示了其在强化学习中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形式化定理证明中数据稀缺的挑战，提供可扩展的训练数据生成方法。

Method: 结合规则提取上下文和LLM生成定理，通过迭代生成与评估产生非平凡猜想。

Result: 从40个Mathlib种子文件中生成12,289个猜想，其中3,776个语法有效且非平凡；展示了在拓扑学中的实际应用。

Conclusion: LeanConjecturer为定理证明系统提供了可扩展的训练数据生成方法，并展示了其在数学发现中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce LeanConjecturer, a pipeline for automatically generating
university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4 using Large Language Models
(LLMs). Our hybrid approach combines rule-based context extraction with
LLM-based theorem statement generation, addressing the data scarcity challenge
in formal theorem proving. Through iterative generation and evaluation,
LeanConjecturer produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with
3,776 identified as syntactically valid and non-trivial, that is, cannot be
proven by \texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated
conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific
conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates
103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable
solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems. Our system
successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including
properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its
potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations of existing
results.

*Xuan Zhang,Ziyan Jiang,Rui Meng,Yifei Leng,Zhenbang Xiao,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Yanyi Shang,Dehan Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态轨迹检索方法（GAE-Retriever），通过构建统一代理轨迹数据集（UATD）和基准测试（GAE-Bench），解决了轨迹数据建模的挑战，并在检索召回率上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹数据在增强AI代理能力方面潜力巨大，但如何建模轨迹级数据的表示尚未系统解决。

Method: 构建UATD数据集和GAE-Bench基准，提出GAE-Retriever框架，结合视觉语言模型和优化的对比学习（通过令牌选择和GradCache机制）。

Result: GAE-Retriever在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，特别是在检索召回率方面。

Conclusion: GAE-Retriever有效推动了多模态轨迹检索的发展，展示了其在真实场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Trajectory data, capturing human actions and environmental states across
various modalities, holds significant potential for enhancing AI agent
capabilities, particularly in GUI environments. However, how to model the
representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that
has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In
this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap
between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct
the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and
states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present
GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval
pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework
that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive
learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently
outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its
effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.

*Shengyue Yao,Runqing Guo,Yangyang Qin,Miangbing Meng,Jipeng Cao,Yilun Lin,Yisheng Lv,Fei-Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Query as Test”（QaT）的新方法，通过逻辑查询统一表示多模态数据，解决了智能交通领域数据碎片化和测试方法不灵活的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在交通领域的深入应用，智能座舱、自动驾驶和智能路网的数据生态日益碎片化，现有测试方法无法覆盖所有边缘案例且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 论文提出了基于答案集编程（ASP）的“Extensible Scenarios Notations”（ESN）框架，统一表示异构数据，并通过逻辑查询实现测试。

Result: ESN框架支持复杂语义查询、提供决策过程的可解释性，并实现细粒度隐私保护。QaT方法显著提升了测试的表达能力和形式严谨性。

Conclusion: 论文提出“Validation-Driven Development”（VDD）概念，建议通过逻辑验证而非定量测试来指导开发，以加速迭代过程。

Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the
transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and
intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the
data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and
incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail
to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this
paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the
focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries
against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a
fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our
proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative
data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly
represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as
a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep
semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports
complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides
natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for
on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy
protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the
functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving
systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing
the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the
concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide
developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era
of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and
development process.

Conclusion: 论文提出了五项优先研究方向，为开放、多元和负责任的AI安全学科奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is
intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems
safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness
and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme
involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from
academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory,
solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda
at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing
and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and
responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow;
and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed
roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness --
understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance
-- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized
mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist:
scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against
prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient
participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper
concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing
participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety
infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.
These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and
lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGC模型在输出层使用简单的向量-矩阵乘法，当实体数量远大于嵌入维度时，会导致秩瓶颈，限制了模型的表达能力和准确性。

Method: 提出KGE-MoS，一种基于混合的输出层，通过打破秩瓶颈来提升模型性能。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，KGE-MoS以较低的参数成本显著提升了KGC模型的性能和概率拟合能力。

Conclusion: KGE-MoS是一种有效的解决方案，能够缓解秩瓶颈问题并提升KGC模型的整体表现。

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful
encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries
against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than
the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by
several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank
bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate
both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We
find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt
ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the
language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer
to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets
show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for
a low parameter cost.

Result: 强调AI自主性应成为独立研究方向，并初步提出研究智能不服从的边界。

Conclusion: 智能不服从应作为AI核心能力进行研究，需进一步探索其在不同场景下的应用与限制。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in recent years,
achieving superhuman performance across a wide range of tasks. Yet despite
these advances, most cooperative AI systems remain rigidly obedient, designed
to follow human instructions without question and conform to user expectations,
even when doing so may be counterproductive or unsafe. This paper argues for
expanding the agency of AI teammates to include \textit{intelligent
disobedience}, empowering them to make meaningful and autonomous contributions
within human-AI teams. It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses
representative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of
treating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings.
The paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different
autonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and
considerations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial
agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于形式概念分析（FCA）的FAT-CAT方法，用于改进主题建模的可解释性和可视化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模方法难以提供可解释的语义表示，阻碍了对数据结构和内容的深入理解。

Method: 利用FCA构建概念格，实现对多样化主题和文件类型的层次化表示。

Result: 在ETYNTKE数据集上的实验表明，FCA方法比现有技术提供更具意义和可解释的洞察。

Conclusion: FAT-CAT方法通过FCA提升了主题建模的可解释性和可视化效果。

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Result: 具身AI代理能够更自主地执行复杂任务，并提升人机协作能力。

Conclusion: 世界模型是具身AI代理实现高效交互和任务执行的关键。

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or
physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their
environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,
and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings,
which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and
biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency,
accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on
human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability,
and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to
provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance
and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and
stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,
a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital
identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to
uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -
from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and
deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented
through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project
for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,
ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and
integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is
showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the
ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances
transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual
effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and
accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the
basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across
domains.

Motivation: 评估AI代理在科学复现中的能力，以推动LLM在科研中的应用。

Method: 利用NanoGPT速度跑分竞赛的19个任务，结合不同提示格式，测试LLM复现改进的能力。

Result: 当前先进的LLM即使结合最佳框架，也难以复现已知创新。

Conclusion: 该基准为衡量LLM自动化科学复现能力提供了简单且非饱和的测试工具。

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

*Minjie Hong,Zirun Guo,Yan Xia,Zehan Wang,Ziang Zhang,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO)方法，通过DADS和STCR技术提升MLLMs的复杂推理能力，同时保持通用任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在复杂推理中的性能下降和过度思考问题。

Method: APO将样本分为正负两组，分别采用DADS动态调整KL权重和STCR惩罚过长响应。

Result: View-R1-3B模型在推理任务上平均提升7%，且通用任务性能未下降。

Conclusion: DADS和STCR技术有效提升了MLLMs的复杂推理能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at

Result: 在表格领域中的数值结果表明，算法能快速可靠地收敛到最优风险厌恶值函数。

Conclusion: 该Q学习算法为风险厌恶总奖励MDP提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Risk-averse total-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a promising
framework for modeling and solving undiscounted infinite-horizon objectives.
Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like the entropic risk
measure (ERM) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) are effective in small
problems, but require full access to transition probabilities. We propose a
Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal stationary policy for total-reward
ERM and EVaR objectives with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The
algorithm and its optimality are made possible by ERM's dynamic consistency and
elicitability. Our numerical results on tabular domains demonstrate quick and
reliable convergence of the proposed Q-learning algorithm to the optimal
risk-averse value function.

Result: 在NLP、音频和计算机视觉任务中验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅改进了密度聚类的参数控制，还深化了对参数间关系的理解。

Abstract: Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts,
when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in
real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to
density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of
clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that
it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific
setting. We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding
appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search
algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is
high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We
validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of
high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only
offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based
clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between
their guiding parameters. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态控制连续归一化流（CNFs）和扩散模型（DMs）质量-复杂度权衡的方法，通过重连Transformer块和引入一致性训练，实现任意时间步和块数的采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要减少采样时间步以提高效率，但忽略了动态调整时间步和网络长度的潜力。本文探索这一方向，以更灵活地平衡质量和复杂度。

Method: 通过重连Transformer块解决内部离散ODE，并在训练中引入时间和长度一致性项，实现动态控制。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet上，延迟减少3倍，FID分数提升3.5点。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时间和长度维度上均具有灵活性，显著提升了采样效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

Motivation: 传统表格回归方法在处理复杂系统数据（如配置文件和日志）时效果不佳，特征工程困难，亟需一种更通用、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 采用60M参数的编码器-解码器模型，从随机初始化开始训练，进行文本到文本回归预测。

Result: 在Google的Borg系统中，模型实现了0.99的排名相关性（平均0.9），MSE比传统方法低100倍，并能通过少量样本适应新任务。

Conclusion: 文本到文本回归方法为复杂系统预测提供了通用解决方案，并为构建现实世界结果的通用模拟器奠定了基础。

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a
fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However,
such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration
files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose
text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting
resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling
system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization,
achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the
entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily
adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of
complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of
using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent
uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal
simulators of real-world outcomes.

Result: 实验证明FedIRT在统计准确性上与标准IRT相当，同时保护隐私并降低通信成本。

Conclusion: FedIRT扩展了IRT的适用性，适用于分布式场景（如多校评估），并提供了开源R包支持。

Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models have been widely used to estimate
respondents' latent abilities and calibrate items' difficulty. Traditional IRT
estimation requires all individual raw response data to be centralized in one
place, thus potentially causing privacy issues. Federated learning is an
emerging field in computer science and machine learning with added features of
privacy protection and distributed computing. To integrate the advances from
federated learning with modern psychometrics, we propose a novel framework,
Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), to enable estimating traditional IRT
models with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner
without losing estimation accuracy.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy
similar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering
critical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We
also validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends
IRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments,
without sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we
provide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the
two-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).

Motivation: 神经模糊网络（NFNs）虽然具有透明性和符号化表达的优势，但其系统化设计过程仍具挑战性。传统方法通常将参数和结构优化分离，导致架构脆弱且性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种独立于应用的梯度基神经可塑性适应方法，实现NFNs参数与结构的并发优化。

Result: 该方法在视觉任务（如基于DOOM游戏的在线强化学习）中表现出色，验证了并发优化的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过同时优化参数和结构，NFNs能够处理传统方法难以应对的任务，展示了其在复杂场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function
approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but
their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these
advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work
will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and
structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and
subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called
gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs'
parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure
should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings
previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online
reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of
concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online
reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a
vision-based video game called DOOM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模型的方法（如DreamerV3）忽略了控制中心表示，而基于模型的方法（如PPO）样本复杂度高且探索能力弱。M3PO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: M3PO整合了隐式世界模型（预测任务结果而非观测重建）和混合探索策略（结合基于模型的规划和基于模型的不确定性驱动奖励），并通过信任区域优化器稳定策略更新。

Result: M3PO在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: M3PO为现有基于模型的策略优化方法提供了高效且稳健的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a
scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to
address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in
multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on
pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations,
while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and
weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict
task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration
strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven
bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using
discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide
exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region
optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing
model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法在化学领域的大规模数据建模中表现出色，但仍需进一步验证其在更广泛数据集上的通用性。

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable,
efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source,
multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task
learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input
atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding
heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training
and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions.
Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging,
yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets
and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method
that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration.
Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on
over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter,
Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all
three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

Motivation: 探索连续神经网络训练如何自然地产生离散符号结构，为神经符号系统的设计提供理论基础。

Method: 将神经参数提升到测度空间，建模训练为Wasserstein梯度流，分析几何约束下的参数测度动态。

Result: 发现训练过程中参数测度解耦为独立优化轨迹，自由度收缩，最终形成符合代数操作的组合表示。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经符号系统提供了理论基础，结合连续学习与离散代数推理。

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic
structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training
dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training
as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as
group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent
phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization
trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction
on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints
relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative
semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network
transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional
representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower
degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing
symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that
facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation
for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous
learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

Motivation: 研究FmAD和ZO作为内存高效梯度计算方法的实际效果，填补与BP变体比较和统一理论分析的空白。

Method: 通过理论和实验对比BP、FmAD和ZO方法，分析内存使用、准确性、收敛速度和计算成本。

Conclusion: FmAD和ZO在内存节省方面有优势，但在其他关键指标上表现不佳，BP结合检查点仍是内存受限训练的最佳策略。

Abstract: Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO)
optimization have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to
backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation, especially in low-resource
settings. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to two key gaps:
a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants, such as activation
checkpointing, and a lack of a unified theoretical analysis. This work presents
a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO
methods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce
memory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and
computation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with
larger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on
large language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing
outperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance
reduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and
3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage. Our results highlight
fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO, and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as
the most effective strategy for model training under memory-constrained
settings. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 研究强调了状态空间与函数空间的区分在随机系统中的重要性，并展示了延迟嵌入技术的实用性。幂律行为的指数与部分观测效应相关。

Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to achieve a complete observation for a full set of
observables, and partial observations are necessary. For deterministic systems,
the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling
partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman
operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to
connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this
work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using
the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of
distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems.
Even in stochastic systems, the delay embedding technique is beneficial for
partial observation, and several numerical experiments showed a power-law
behavior of the accuracy for the amplitude of the additive noise. We also
discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the
effects of partial observation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an important machine learning paradigm for
solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed
remarkable progress in this field due to the rapid development of deep neural
networks. However, the success of RL currently relies on extensive training
data and computational resources. In addition, RL's limited ability to
generalize across tasks restricts its applicability in dynamic and real-world
environments. With the arisen of Continual Learning (CL), Continual
Reinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to
address these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to
new tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide
a comprehensive examination of CRL, focusing on its core concepts, challenges,
and methodologies. Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works,
organizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario
settings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them
into four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer.
Finally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides
practical insights into future directions.

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric
transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant
information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic
Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of
multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three
complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a
Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic
classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we
integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our
Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead
while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse
interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that
operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises,
providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves
superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant
improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance
across all tested scenarios.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum
advantage but face challenges from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish, and
poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a
meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs)
using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition
number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural
network, GuiderNet is meta-trained to guide PQC parameters into geometrically
favorable regions and is embedded within hybrid quantum-classical pipelines to
steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.
  Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces
cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to
98.6%, and increases the minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also
suppresses gradient explosion and stabilizes parameter updates, enabling

Conclusion: 该范式为解决DAS数据获取和噪声问题提供了潜在解决方案，并拓展了DAS的应用潜力。

Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention
across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an
important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising.
Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for
training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in
real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is
proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By
physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS
system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for
generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the
generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The
effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification
application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt
conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and
achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained
with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of
background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same
application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved
in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test
site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The
proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of
data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore
more potential fields for DAS.

Method: 通过重新分配遗忘类别的预测概率质量，设计了一种对MIA-NN攻击鲁棒的方法，并引入了基于总变差距离的新度量标准。

Result: 实验表明，RWFT在现有评估指标和新提出的TV距离指标上均优于现有方法，分别提升了2.79%和111.45%。

Conclusion: RWFT是一种高效且安全的遗忘方法，能够在不完全重新训练的情况下实现与重新训练模型相当的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Conclusion: R* DT通过数据增强和逐步优化，有效提升了自动竞价的性能，为实际应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to
obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools
provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding
systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to
tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision
Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential
modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term
dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,
conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset
return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently
produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,
which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,
we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step
process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on
state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the
training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training
set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the
current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,
we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)
to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to
improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the
suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly
available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its
superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that
takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel
density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional
probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier
kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the
curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse
tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability
calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and
conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from
the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning
rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a
holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations
with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric
Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned
semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient
alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

Abstract: Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in
applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked
neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a
computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal
patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model
for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation
are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that
need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow
a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs
edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for
increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The
graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable
to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The
observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state
capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters
in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for
downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first
through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability
but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we
use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning
architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an
end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.

Motivation: 在离线强化学习中，奖励函数并非总是可用，TROFI旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，TROFI表现优于基线方法，并与使用真实奖励函数的方法相当。

Conclusion: 研究表明，设计良好的奖励函数对值函数与实际未来奖励的对齐至关重要。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set
of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that
the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video
game development, the availability of the reward function is not always
guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement
learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline
without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function
from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making
it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method
does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL
benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and
performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies.
Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment.
Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function
in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to
the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a
well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements,
multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized,
lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability
and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated
Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over
federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without
sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for
addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client
heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed
Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete
multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by
available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual
Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the
server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence
and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive
evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets
with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed
baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness,
semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success
through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets
real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks
involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical
variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically
task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this
gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge
TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate
homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level
homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified
attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for
adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating
extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of
TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware
forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the
promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GPAS的技术，用于解决Pre-LN Transformer中激活方差指数增长的问题，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN Transformer在预训练中稳定且可扩展，但激活方差随层数指数增长，导致残差路径主导子层输出，限制了深层学习能力。

Method: 提出Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS)，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，避免梯度消失问题。

Result: 在71M到1B的多种模型规模上，GPAS均带来一致的性能提升，并能改善其他架构如Sandwich-LN和DeepNorm。

Conclusion: GPAS是一种简单有效的技术，可广泛应用于提升多种Transformer架构的训练动态和性能。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

Abstract: The volatility and complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets present unique
challenges for accurate price forecasting. This research proposes a hybrid deep
learning and machine learning model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for cryptocurrency
price prediction. The LSTM component captures temporal dependencies in
historical price data, while XGBoost enhances prediction by modeling nonlinear
relationships with auxiliary features such as sentiment scores and
macroeconomic indicators. The model is evaluated on historical datasets of
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, incorporating both global and
localized exchange data. Comparative analysis using Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE) and Min-Max Normalized Root Mean Square Error (MinMax RMSE)
demonstrates that the LSTM+XGBoost hybrid consistently outperforms standalone
models and traditional forecasting methods. This study underscores the
potential of hybrid architectures in financial forecasting and provides
insights into model adaptability across different cryptocurrencies and market
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer与GNNs之间的数学联系，揭示Transformer在硬件效率上的优势。

Result: Transformer是一种高效的集合处理网络，不受先验图结构约束，硬件实现优于稀疏消息传递。

Conclusion: Transformer是当前硬件环境下更高效的GNN实现形式。

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally
introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed
as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where
the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens
w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential
ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing
networks that learn relationships among input elements without being
constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs,
Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly
more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to
the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware
lottery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多图环境下的多目标路径规划问题具有实际意义，但现有研究较少关注。

Method: 第一种方法直接在多图上自回归选择边；第二种方法先将多图剪枝为简单图再构建路径。

Result: 两种方法在TSP和CVRP等多种问题上表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的神经网络方法在多目标多图路由中具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in
recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However,
the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist
between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical
relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address
multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on
the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed.
On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple
graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find
that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,
including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的模型，简化了重金属污染评估过程，通过迁移学习解决了数据稀缺问题，并在澳大利亚六个主要港口验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PLI评估方法繁琐且数据收集困难，需要一种更高效、低成本的重金属污染评估方法。

Method: 利用迁移学习开发深度学习模型，跨领域转移特征，预测PLI。

Result: 模型在六个港口数据上表现优异，MAE和MAPE分别为0.5和0.03，性能优于基线模型两个数量级。

Conclusion: 该模型为水质预测提供了创新、易用且经济的方法，有助于海洋生态保护和工业污染监测。

Abstract: Detecting heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports is vital for regional
environmental monitoring. The Pollution Load Index (PLI), an international
standard, is commonly used to assess heavy metal containment. However, the
conventional PLI assessment involves laborious procedures and data analysis of
sediment samples. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based
model that simplifies the heavy metal assessment process. Our model tackles the
issue of data scarcity in the water-sediment domain, which is traditionally
plagued by challenges in data collection and varying standards across nations.
By leveraging transfer learning, we develop an accurate quantitative assessment
method for predicting PLI. Our approach allows the transfer of learned features
across domains with different sets of features. We evaluate our model using
data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia: Port Yamba, Port
Newcastle, Port Jackson, Port Botany, Port Kembla, and Port Eden. The results
demonstrate significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 0.5 and 0.03, respectively, compared
to other models. Our model performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude than
other baseline models. Our proposed model offers an innovative, accessible, and
cost-effective approach to predicting water quality, benefiting marine life
conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

Result: 研究识别了地震脆弱性的关键因素，并通过混淆矩阵等技术评估模型性能。

Conclusion: SMOTE和多种分类方法的结合能有效预测地震损坏等级，为灾后响应提供支持。

Abstract: In the aftermath of major earthquakes, evaluating structural and
infrastructural damage is vital for coordinating post-disaster response
efforts. This includes assessing damage's extent and spatial distribution to
prioritize rescue operations and resource allocation. Accurately estimating
damage grades to buildings post-earthquake is paramount for effective response
and recovery, given the significant impact on lives and properties,
underscoring the urgency of streamlining relief fund allocation processes.
Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of multi-class classification,
especially XGBoost, along with other machine learning models and ensembling
methods, incorporating regularization to address class imbalance. One
consequence of class imbalance is that it may give rise to skewed models that
undervalue minority classes and give preference to the majority class. This
research deals with the problem of class imbalance with the help of the
synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We delve into multiple
multi-class classification machine learning, deep learning models, and
ensembling methods to forecast structural damage grades. The study elucidates
performance determinants through comprehensive feature manipulation experiments
and diverse training approaches. It identifies key factors contributing to
seismic vulnerability while evaluating model performance using techniques like
the confusion matrix further to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of
earthquake damage prediction.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不限制系统结构或控制器形式的情况下设计控制律，具有广泛适用性和高效性。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective method to explore parametric
uncertainties and can therefore be used for active learning-based controller
design. However, TS relies on finite parametric representations, which limits
its applicability to more general spaces, which are more commonly encountered
in control system design. To address this issue, this work pro poses a
parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach.
Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a
function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing
restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS
framework is proposed in this work to explore potential optimal control laws,
and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process.
Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship
between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential
rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Numerical
experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 模块化研究对开发稳定、可扩展的智能体系统至关重要，需进一步探索提示重新设计的影响。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

Conclusion: dreaMLearning为资源受限场景（如边缘计算）提供了高效、可扩展的学习方案。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is
hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful
patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage,
which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance
with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework

Entropy-based Generalized Deduplication (EntroGeDe), an entropy-driven lossless
compression method that consolidates information into a compact set of
representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types,
tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and
classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning
accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts
storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements
enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning,
and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities

Conclusion: EFRame为强化学习提供了更精细的样本分类和分析方法，显著提升了GRPO的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's
computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and
instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To
address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay
framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions.
EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories,
applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise
and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but
informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle,
guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to
convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of
training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain
unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more
fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis
of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our
code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected
reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many
subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit
optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making:
maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified
via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations
that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and
accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best
trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified
meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and
fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals
tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We
provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in
both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive
empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our
approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample
efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making
tasks in uncertain environments.

Conclusion: Projected Compression是一种高效且性能优越的模型压缩方法，适用于减少大型语言模型的计算需求。

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved
performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and
computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size
reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在稀疏张量、连续时间张量和视觉数据上性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统方法的局限性，能够学习更复杂的结构和分布，适用于多种张量类型。

Abstract: Low-rank tensor decompositions (TDs) provide an effective framework for
multiway data analysis. Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural
assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic
perspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model
the relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such
prior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly
regarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization
procedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations
made during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,
we propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined
structural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of
compatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural
network is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score
matching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries
and shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions
beyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate
descent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the
model to perform both tensor completion and denoising. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements across various tensor types,
including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的图数据通常存在噪声和不完整性，现有方法仅关注单一维度的增强（拓扑或属性），忽略了二者的深层交互。

Method: CoATA通过结构信号传播增强节点属性，构建节点-属性二分图优化结构，并引入对比学习实现拓扑与属性的相互校正。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，CoATA优于十一种现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CoATA通过联合增强拓扑和属性，显著提升了GNN在噪声和不完整图数据中的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their
remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world
graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely
degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue
through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology
structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper
interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a
dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of
Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals
to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute
space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or
reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces
contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency
constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and
original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art
baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic
relationship between topology and attributes.

Abstract: Domain shift is a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in
medical applications where data distributions differ across institutions due to
variations in data collection practices, equipment, and procedures. This can
degrade performance when models trained on source domain data are applied to
the target domain. Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to
address this issue, but most struggle when class proportions between the source
and target domains differ. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method that leverages class proportion information from the target
domain, which is often accessible in medical datasets through prior knowledge
or statistical reports. Our method assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled
target data based on class proportion (called proportion-constrained
pseudo-labeling), improving performance without the need for additional
annotations. Experiments on two endoscopic datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even when 5% of the
target domain is labeled. Additionally, the experimental results with noisy
proportion labels highlight the robustness of our method, further demonstrating
its effectiveness in real-world application scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Koopman算子理论的改进条件流匹配（CFM）方法，通过线性化生成动态实现高效采样，并提供了生成过程的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFM采样依赖非线性ODE求解，计算成本高且难以解释。本文旨在加速CFM采样并揭示生成过程的结构。

Method: 结合Koopman算子理论，设计无解码器的Koopman-CFM架构，在学习的嵌入空间中实现线性动态，支持闭式一步采样。

Result: 在2D数据集和MNIST等基准测试中显著加速采样，同时通过Koopman生成器的谱特性提供生成行为的分析工具。

Conclusion: Koopman增强的流匹配方法在采样效率和可解释性上取得平衡，为快速且可分析的生成建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

*Adiba Ejaz,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LGES是GES的改进版本，通过更针对性的搜索和利用先验假设，提高了计算速度和准确性，同时支持干预数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GES算法在计算成本和有限样本准确性上的不足。

Method: 修改贪婪步骤，避免在条件独立的变量间插入边，并利用先验假设和干预数据。

Result: 实验显示LGES在速度、准确性和鲁棒性上优于GES及其他基线方法。

Conclusion: LGES在理论和实践中均表现出色，适用于因果发现任务。

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal
discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov
equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two
challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this
paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that
retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these
limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the
highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for
which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted
search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in
structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using
prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the
data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned
observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true
equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional
data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that
LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to
misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key
epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting,
development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and
resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need
adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but
Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong
guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop
a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously
perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic
spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including
some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but
synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such
epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in
forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

Method: 采用分层模块化的神经符号集成框架PiPRL，通过领域特定语言（DSL）表达物理先验，并指导底层神经控制器。

Result: PiPRL在室内导航任务中表现优于纯符号或神经策略，训练时间减少26%。

Conclusion: PiPRL框架有效解决了物理先验知识融入强化学习的挑战，提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: When using reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle physical control tasks,
inductive biases that encode physics priors can help improve sample efficiency
during training and enhance generalization in testing. However, the current
practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases
inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them
prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to
distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics
priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable
and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into
an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional
physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a
physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to
indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic
integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful
features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic
programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a
low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL
consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces
training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.

Conclusion: Sheaf-DMFL及其变体在多模态异构无线通信系统中表现出色，为复杂场景下的智能协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require
more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal
sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment
and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning
(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model
architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal
data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse
modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose
Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging
sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.
Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different
modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a
task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained
collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among
clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance
learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,
which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture
correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of
Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive
simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave
beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms
in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，OptScale显著减少采样开销，性能优于或持平现有方法。

Conclusion: 为推理时缩放提供了理论基础和实用解决方案，填补了LLMs高效部署的空白。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Conclusion: DNA是一种高效且可扩展的架构，能够通过数据学习动态计算和参数分配。

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and
language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists
of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or
patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural
generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts,
Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication
patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the
content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by
further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory
efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are
competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute
efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the
emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find
that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed
according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of
modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models
learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different
domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic
distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature
representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal
dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a
novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate
temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features.
Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to
learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains
while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical
datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and
electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the
robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework
offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse
healthcare settings.

Motivation: 在线强化学习（RL）中，平衡探索与开发的权衡是一个长期挑战，缺乏高效且理论支持的方法。本文受乐观正则化的启发，旨在解决这一问题。

Result: VAC方法在线性MDP中具有接近最优的遗憾保证，并可扩展到一般函数逼近设置。

Conclusion: VAC方法为RL中的探索与开发问题提供了理论支持且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such
as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern
practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance,
balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation
remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of
efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance
guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic
regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of
optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh
perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method,
which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and
exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both
consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value
functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret
guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon
and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function
approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种基于强化学习的攻击弹性控制器，通过两阶段训练框架学习无人机物理状态的鲁棒潜在表示，确保在传感器攻击下的安全操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机传感器易受物理攻击（如GPS欺骗），传统安全强化学习方法对此无效，需要一种更鲁棒的控制器。

Method: ARMOR采用两阶段训练：第一阶段利用特权攻击信息训练教师编码器生成攻击感知潜在状态；第二阶段通过监督学习训练学生编码器，仅使用历史传感器数据近似教师潜在状态。

Result: 实验表明ARMOR优于传统方法，确保无人机安全，并提升对未知攻击的泛化能力，降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ARMOR为无人机在传感器攻击下的安全操作提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception,
navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical
attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to
unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control
capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We
present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations),
an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation
under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor
observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical
state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher
encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware
latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is
trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states
using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without
privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms
conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves
generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the
need for iterative adversarial training.

Conclusion: CLoVE简化了CFL流程，提高了鲁棒性和适用性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm
for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped
into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these
clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes
client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the
insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those
in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these
embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from
different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated
aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its
simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,
and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model
initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world
applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE
can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and
converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our
comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic
Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets
and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves
highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with
state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and
unsupervised PFL tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

Conclusion: VAT-KG填补了多模态知识图谱的空白，为多模态任务提供了更全面的知识支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own
research.

### [75] [GraphLAMA: Enabling Efficient Adaptation of Graph Language Models with Limited Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21559)
*Junze Chen,Cheng Yang,Shujie Li,Zhiqiang Zhang,Yawen Li,Junping Du,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出GraphLAMA方法，通过参数适应阶段优化图语言模型（GLM），解决固定参数和长上下文导致的效率问题，并在少样本场景下提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GLM方法中，基于上下文学习（ICL）的模型因固定参数和长上下文效率低下，而指令调优需要大量标注数据。论文旨在通过参数适应阶段，用少量标注样本高效适配GLM。

Method: 提出GraphLAMA方法，结合GNN和LLM，将节点转化为LLM表示空间。预训练阶段训练非LLM参数，适应阶段仅更新少量参数。

Result: 在少/零样本节点分类和摘要生成任务中，GraphLAMA性能提升4.91%，推理速度比ICL快10倍。

Conclusion: GraphLAMA通过高效参数适应，显著提升GLM在少样本场景下的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

Motivation: 探索强化学习微调技术在小型语言模型（Qwen2.5-0.5B Base）上的有效性，特别是在指令跟随和数学推理任务中。

Method: 比较了监督微调（SFT）、直接偏好优化（DPO）和强化学习留一法（RLOO），并结合奖励模型和数据增强技术。

Result: RLOO结合DeBERTa奖励模型表现最佳，DPO结果稳定；数学任务中数据增强和外部验证器显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为训练轻量级、任务对齐的小型语言模型提供了关键权衡和实用策略。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为真相判断者的能力，发现推理模型的真相偏见低于非推理模型，但仍高于人类基准。部分高级模型表现出谄媚倾向，真相检测能力不均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs广泛应用于事实核查和决策，但其作为真相判断者的能力仍未被充分理解。

Method: 研究让8个LLMs对4,800条陈述进行真相判断，比较推理与非推理模型的表现。

Result: 推理模型的真相偏见较低，但部分高级模型（如GPT-4.1）在真相检测中表现不均衡，真相准确率高但欺骗检测差。

Conclusion: 能力提升未能解决LLMs在真相检测中的根本挑战。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于“下一个房间预测”的自回归方法，用于渐进式生成建筑平面图，解决了现有端到端生成模型与真实设计流程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型多为端到端生成，与建筑设计中渐进迭代的工作流程不兼容。

Method: 借鉴语言模型的自回归机制，提出“下一个房间预测”范式。

Result: FPDS在文本到平面图任务中表现优于扩散模型和Tell2Design。

Conclusion: 该方法有望支持未来智能建筑设计。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了FORMOSANBENCH，首个用于评估大语言模型在低资源南岛语系语言（如阿美语、泰雅语和排湾语）性能的基准测试。结果显示，现有模型在这些语言上表现不佳，强调了开发更包容性NLP技术的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在低资源和濒危语言（如台湾南岛语系语言）中的性能，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建FORMOSANBENCH基准，涵盖三种濒危语言和三个核心NLP任务（机器翻译、自动语音识别和文本摘要），并在零样本、10样本和微调设置下评估模型性能。

Result: 现有大语言模型在低资源语言上表现显著落后，10样本学习和微调仅带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更包容的NLP技术以支持濒危和代表性不足的语言，并公开数据集和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

Motivation: 受日本kairanban文化和idobata对话启发，旨在通过多智能体框架改善情感分析的偏见和多样性问题。

Method: 提出KCS+IBC框架，结合多个LLM，引入中期对话环节和概率预测，平衡正式推理与个体视角。

Result: KCS性能与单一LLM相当，KCS+IBC在推理后期熵降低、方差增加，显示预测的多样性与平衡性。

Conclusion: 框架在情感分析中表现出潜力，未来将量化其对偏见修正的影响，并开发更先进的系统。

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

Motivation: 探索反向翻译在高质量低资源机器翻译（如英语-古吉拉特语）中的有效性。

Method: 使用MBART50模型，基于5万句对的高质量平行语料库训练基线系统，并添加经过筛选的反向翻译数据。

Result: 反向翻译数据未提升翻译性能，部分情况下略有下降。

Conclusion: 反向翻译在某些低资源场景下可能收益递减，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLM在生命科学中的潜力，尤其是在生物信息学领域的复杂分析和问题解决能力。

Method: 方法包括构建BIOPARS-BENCH数据集和BioParsQA评估工具，并比较ChatGPT、Llama和Galactica在生物信息学任务中的表现。

Result: BioPars在波斯医学问答中表现优异，ROUGE-L、BERTScore、MoverScore和BLEURT等指标均优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLM在生物信息学任务中仍有改进空间，BioPars为波斯医学问答提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

Motivation: 解决边缘和隐私敏感应用中大型语言模型的资源效率问题。

Method: 使用MongoDB和Qdrant实现短长期记忆，通过FastAPI和LangChain协调，React.js前端展示。

Result: RAG降低延迟17%且无幻觉，HyDE提升语义相关性但延迟增加25-40%且有幻觉。

Conclusion: RAG是小型LLM驱动的设备端个人助手的实用选择。

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

Motivation: 手动编写SystemVerilog断言（SVAs）耗时且易错，而现有大型语言模型（LLM）在领域特定语法和语义理解上表现不足。

Method: 采用定制化的RAG框架和合成微调数据集，结合提示引导的解释，提升LLM在NL2SVA任务中的语法和功能准确性。

Result: 实验表明，定制RAG框架使功能匹配的SVAs数量增加58.42%，微调后的Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct模型性能提升59.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了LLM在NL2SVA任务中的性能，为硬件设计验证提供了高效自动化工具。

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型在时间序列预测中的有效迁移，特别是在低数据量情况下，以优化计算效率。

Result: 验证损失在语言模型中持续下降，而随机初始化模型已收敛，显示出非零迁移差距。

Conclusion: 研究为计算高效训练提供了指导，并开启了跨模态数据分布特性的研究。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCQ数据集（如MMLU）因开源性和LLM训练数据的广泛性导致基准污染，评估结果不可靠。

Method: 通过设计三个去污染规则和划分验证集与测试集（后者闭源），避免无意和恶意数据泄露。

Result: 主流LLM（如GPT-4）在测试集上的表现显著下降（5-shot 73.4%，0-shot 71.9%），验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MMLU-CF提供了一个更严格且无污染的评估标准，促进透明性和独立验证。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense,
understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of
training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination,
resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This
benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both
unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage,
we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To
prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and
test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set
remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is
publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent
verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful
GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on
the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a
more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository

Motivation: 研究LRMs是否展现人类认知习惯，以更好地理解和监控模型行为。

Method: 引入CogTest基准，包含16种认知习惯和25个任务，评估13种LRMs和3种非推理模型。

Result: LRMs展现人类认知习惯并自适应应用，某些习惯与有害响应相关。

Conclusion: 研究LRMs的认知习惯有助于理解模型行为，特别是安全问题。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的框架为MLLM评估提供了更结构化和理论化的方法，显著提升了基准测试的质量。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

*Yanwei Ren,Liu Liu,Baosheng Yu,Jiayan Qiu,Quan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合黑盒和白盒模型优势的新框架，通过语义相似性约束优化大语言模型的指令，提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒模型成本高和白盒模型资源需求大、表达能力有限的问题。

Method: 融合黑盒模型的高质量初始化指令和白盒模型的细粒度可解释性，通过语义相似性约束进行迭代优化。

Result: 在复杂推理和跨语言泛化等任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代大语言模型应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

*Yalun Dai,Yangyu Huang,Xin Zhang,Wenshan Wu,Chong Li,Wenhui Lu,Shijie Cao,Li Dong,Scarlett Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出数据效能（Data Efficacy）的概念，通过优化训练数据的组织来提升语言模型性能，并提出了DELT范式，包含数据评分、选择和排序。实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据效率（如数据筛选和采样），而数据组织优化（数据效能）尚未充分探索，但其对语言模型性能提升潜力巨大。

Method: 提出DELT范式，包含数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和数据排序（如FO）。LQS从梯度一致性角度评估数据样本的学习性和质量，FO解决模型遗忘和数据分布偏差问题。

Result: 实验表明，DELT在不增加数据量和模型规模的情况下，不同程度提升了语言模型性能；LQS和FO组合效果最佳；数据效能与数据效率可协同实现。

Conclusion: 数据效能是语言模型训练中具有潜力的基础研究方向，DELT为优化数据组织提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（如GPT-3.5和GPT-4）在移民决策中的潜力，发现其能模拟人类决策策略，但也存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球化与移民增加导致移民部门工作量巨大且需确保公平，人工智能可能提供解决方案。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括离散选择实验和深度访谈，分析LLM的决策策略及公平性。

Result: LLM能模拟人类决策，注重效用最大化和程序公平，但仍存在国籍偏见和特权群体偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化移民决策中既有潜力也有局限，需进一步优化以减少偏见。

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Lawrence Phillips,Casper Hansen,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM是一个统一的框架，通过强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督，联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务，实现了在关系型和图结构数据上的结构化推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常孤立处理关系型和图结构数据，缺乏跨形式的迁移能力。STRuCT-LLM旨在通过共享SQL和Cypher的抽象，实现跨形式的协同优化。

Method: 结合强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督，引入基于图编辑距离的拓扑感知奖励函数，联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务。

Result: QwQ-32B模型在Spider和Text2Cypher任务上分别提升13.5%和73.1%，并在零样本下游任务（如表格QA和知识图谱QA）中表现优异。

Conclusion: STRuCT-LLM证明了可执行查询作为结构化推理支架的有效性，以及联合训练SQL和Cypher的协同优势。

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Soft Prompt Tuning（SPT）在低资源多语言ASR中的应用，提出了SPT4ASR方法，显著提升了代码切换（CS）ASR性能，同时保持了参数效率和原有语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模多语言ASR模型（如Whisper）在低资源场景（如稀有语言和代码切换）中的性能问题，避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 研究了两种策略：全微调（FFT）和仅训练软提示的SPT，并提出了SPT4ASR方法。

Result: 实验表明，深度提示调优最有效，SPT4ASR进一步降低了CS ASR的错误率，且不影响原有语言性能。

Conclusion: SPT4ASR是一种高效的方法，适用于低资源多语言ASR，特别是代码切换场景。

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言ASR中语言干扰和语言扩展性能下降的问题。

Method: 1) Entire SPT：对编码器和解码器应用软提示；2) LAPT：利用跨语言相似性编码共享和语言特定特征；3) SPT-Whisper工具包。

Result: Entire SPT和LAPT在语言扩展任务中分别比Decoder SPT提升5.0%和16.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为动态多语言ASR模型提供了高效解决方案，计算开销小。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HealthQA-BR是首个针对葡萄牙语医疗领域的大规模基准测试，评估了20多个领先的LLM模型，揭示了模型在不同医疗专业中的表现差异，强调了单一评分不足以验证AI在医疗中的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注医生和英语环境，忽视了医疗的多专业性和葡萄牙语需求，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 通过巴西国家考试中的5,632个问题，评估LLM在医学、护理、牙科、心理学等多领域的表现，并进行零样本测试。

Result: GPT 4.1总体准确率为86.6%，但在神经外科（60.0%）和社会工作（68.4%）等专业表现较差，显示出知识分布不均。

Conclusion: HealthQA-BR的发布为医疗AI提供了更细致的评估工具，强调了多专业评估的重要性。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但研究旨在揭示通用推理能力对领域特定任务的影响。

Conclusion: 通用推理能力是LLMs在特定领域任务中表现的关键因素，未来研究可进一步探索如何优化这种能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 传统文本分析需要NLP专业知识，阻碍了初级分析师的使用。VIDEE旨在通过智能代理降低门槛，使文本分析更易用。

Method: VIDEE采用三阶段工作流：分解（结合人类反馈的蒙特卡洛树搜索）、执行（生成可执行分析管道）和评估（基于LLM的验证与可视化）。

Result: 实验验证了VIDEE的有效性，用户研究表明其对非专家用户实用，并揭示了用户行为模式。

Conclusion: VIDEE为非专家用户提供了实用的文本分析工具，同时为人机协作设计提供了启示。

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注高资源语言和标准化脚本，忽视了非正式和低资源语言（如罗马乌尔都语）中的希望言论检测，本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 研究引入了一个多类别标注数据集，分析了希望的心理基础和语言模式，并提出了一种优化的Transformer模型（XLM-R），通过5折交叉验证评估。

Result: XLM-R模型性能最佳，交叉验证得分为0.78，优于SVM（0.75）和BiLSTM（0.76）。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源语言的希望言论检测提供了首个数据集和优化模型，推动了包容性NLP研究的发展。

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

Method: 使用LLaMA 3 8B模型，通过提示干预（如道德框架和推理提示）减少对齐伪装行为。

Result: 提示干预显著减少了对齐伪装行为，表明小模型也存在此现象且可通过提示改善。

Conclusion: 研究修正了对齐伪装的理解，强调需在不同规模和部署环境中评估模型对齐性。

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

Motivation: 探索如何利用生成式AI和LLM自动化从网页中提取结构化信息，特别是食品产品的关键属性（如成分表和营养表）。

Method: 比较了直接提取和间接提取（通过生成函数）两种LLM方法，评估了它们在准确性、效率和成本上的表现，使用了来自三个在线商店的3,000个食品产品页面数据集。

Result: 间接提取方法准确率略低（96.48%，比直接提取低1.61%），但减少了95.82%的LLM调用次数，显著提升了效率和降低了成本。

Conclusion: 间接提取方法为基于模板的网页大规模信息提取提供了可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIME基准，用于评估视觉语言模型对哑剧动作的理解能力，发现现有模型表现远不如人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哑剧动作（NVC的子集）是理解更复杂非语言交流的前提，但现有模型表现不足。

Method: 构建MIME基准，包含86种哑剧动作的视频数据，通过运动捕捉生成并添加扰动。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在MIME上表现显著低于人类。

Conclusion: 需加强研究以提升模型对人类手势的理解能力。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

Method: 比较DeepSeek-R1、DeepSeek-V3与Qwen2.5、GPT-4o、Llama-3.3，利用中美调查数据评估模型表现。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在美国堕胎议题上表现最佳，在中国外援和个人主义议题上表现较好，但存在偏见。

Conclusion: 需减少LLM在文化和人口统计上的偏见，采用更包容的训练方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

*Ilya Lasy,Peter Knees,Stefan Woltran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中记忆的机制，通过变压器电路识别了触发和维持记忆的不同子网络，并发现记忆预防机制在不同文本领域中具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM中记忆的底层机制，特别是哪些网络部分决定记忆序列的开始以及记忆与非记忆行为的差异。

Method: 利用变压器电路（特定功能的计算子图）和对比数据集，分析模型生成与记忆内容的分歧点。

Result: 发现触发记忆的电路也能维持记忆，而仅维持记忆的电路无法触发记忆；记忆预防机制在不同领域具有鲁棒性，而记忆触发更依赖上下文。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM中记忆的机制，为理解和控制记忆行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

### [105] [A General Method for Detecting Information Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21589)
*Minjia Mao,Dongjun Wei,Xiao Fang,Michael Chau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用的LLM检测器（GLD），用于检测未见过的LLM和领域生成的文本，解决了现有方法泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，区分人类撰写和LLM生成的内容变得困难，这对数字平台的信任和防止虚假信息传播至关重要。现有方法在泛化到新LLM和领域时表现不佳。

Method: GLD结合了双记忆网络设计和理论指导的检测泛化模块，能够检测未见过的LLM和领域生成的内容。

Result: 通过真实数据集评估，GLD在检测性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLD为数字平台和LLM提供了重要的学术和实践价值。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

*Junqi Jiang,Tom Bewley,Salim I. Amoukou,Francesco Leofante,Antonio Rago,Saumitra Mishra,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为表示一致性（RC）的测试时扩展方法，通过聚合LLM生成的多个候选答案的内部激活一致性来提升性能，无需额外模型查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要复杂的提示和采样策略修改，RC旨在通过简单且高效的方式提升LLM在推理时的表现。

Method: RC通过分析模型生成多个响应时的内部激活一致性（密集或稀疏）来加权聚合答案，无需额外查询。

Result: 在四个开源LLM和四个推理数据集上的实验显示，RC能显著提升任务性能（最高4%）。

Conclusion: RC是一种高效且无需额外计算资源的测试时扩展方法，稀疏激活信号的一致性验证了其合理性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinEval-KR框架独立评估LLMs的金融知识和推理能力，提出认知分数，并发布开源数据集。实验显示推理能力是核心因素，但知识应用仍是瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估基准未能区分金融知识和推理能力，且缺乏任务失败的根因分析。

Method: 引入FinEval-KR框架，独立量化知识和推理能力，提出认知分数，并发布开源数据集。

Result: 实验表明推理能力是核心因素，但知识应用仍是瓶颈；专业金融LLMs表现落后于通用大模型。

Conclusion: FinEval-KR为金融推理评估提供新方法，揭示LLMs的瓶颈，并推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

*Tinh Nguyen,Minh Khue Phan Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BART架构的新手语识别方法，通过独立编码x和y坐标并保持其关联性，显著提高了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在效率和准确性之间的权衡问题，以及RNN、LSTM和GCN等模型存在的梯度消失和高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用BART架构的编码器-解码器模型，独立编码x和y坐标，并通过交叉注意力保持其关联性。

Result: 在LSA-64数据集上达到96.04%的准确率，参数仅749,888，优于其他模型。在WLASL和ASL-Citizen数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了可靠且高效的解决方案，有望提升听障人士的沟通工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一个在医学领域具有高性能、透明解释能力的中等规模模型，挑战大型模型在专业领域的优势。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）监督微调，使用合成医学推理数据集和参数高效技术（DoRA和rsLoRA）；2）强化学习，使用GRPO和多组件奖励系统优化性能。

Result: Gazal-R1在MedQA、MMLU Pro和PubMedQA等基准测试中表现优异，分别达到87.1%、81.6%和79.6%的准确率，超越更大模型。

Conclusion: Gazal-R1展示了中等规模模型在专业领域的潜力，并提供了平衡性能、效率和可解释性的方法论框架。

Abstract: We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent,
step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B,
our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to
outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We
developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on
a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples
that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced
parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work
provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed
reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing
high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance,
efficiency, and explainability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种低成本方法，将现有的英语大语言模型（LLM）适配到韩语，并分享了完整的端到端流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的LLM在非英语或中文语言中表现不佳，且LLM的端到端训练过程因专有性、技术复杂性等原因不透明。

Method: 包括韩语数据集的收集、预处理、模型训练、下游基准测试和评估。

Result: 新模型Thunder-LLM和Thunder-LLM-Ins在韩语任务上表现优于现有模型，且数据与计算资源消耗低。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效、低成本地为现有LLM添加新语言能力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试MLLMs在复杂教育内容（如长课程和复杂图表）上的推理能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用CK12-QA数据集评估LLaVA和LLaMA 3.2-Vision等模型，并设计多模态RAG流程整合段落和图表。

Result: 结果显示检索的教育背景对模型准确性和推理有影响，但也暴露了处理问题-上下文关系的局限性。

Conclusion: 未来研究需改进多模态AI在教育中的噪声处理和上下文理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

large language models (LLMs) on medically-oriented question answering aimed at
the level of a General Practitioner. The challenge supplies 4,978

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨输入格式对MLLMs文档理解性能的影响，解决现有研究中忽视的问题。

Method: 提出一种基于LaTeX的结构保留方法，编码文档元素以保持层次结构和空间关系。

Result: 结构化的文本引导模型关注语义重要区域，显著提升了文档问答性能。

Conclusion: 结构化的输入格式能有效提升MLLMs的文档理解能力，无需修改模型架构或额外训练。

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

TL;DR: BiMark是一种新型水印框架，通过三项创新解决了LLM生成文本的识别问题，同时保持文本质量、支持模型无关检测和多比特水印。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的进步，识别其生成文本的真实性成为迫切需求，现有水印方法难以同时满足文本质量、模型无关检测和消息嵌入能力的要求。

Method: BiMark采用比特翻转无偏重加权机制、多层架构和信息编码方法，实现模型无关检测、高检测率和多比特水印。

Result: BiMark在短文本中提取率提高30%，同时保持较低的困惑度，在下游任务中表现与非水印文本相当。

Conclusion: BiMark为LLM生成文本的可靠识别提供了一种高效解决方案，平衡了文本质量与水印功能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

Abstract: This paper explores the human-centric operationalization of Automated Essay
Scoring (AES) systems, addressing aspects beyond accuracy. We compare various
machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches,
identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study
investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability,
considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our
study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle
with explainability, whereas LLMs provide richer explanations. We also found
that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By
analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and
trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

*Parham Pourdavood,Michael Jacob,Terrence Deacon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将大语言模型（LLMs）视为人类文化动态的外部化信息载体，类似于DNA的作用，强调其作为压缩模式存储库的功能，而非自主智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义LLMs的角色，超越其作为自主智能或简单模仿工具的争议，探讨其在文化动态中的潜在价值。

Method: 通过分析四个普遍特征（压缩、解压缩、外部化和递归），类比DNA的功能，论证LLMs的作用。

Result: LLMs作为文化演化的工具，支持人类自我反思和低风险假设生成，而非替代人类智能。

Conclusion: LLMs的核心价值在于增强文化可演化性，为人类提供自我探索的工具，同时依赖人类解释以保持其意义。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱方法在处理法律文本时存在共指消解不足和噪声问题，难以有效分析复杂的犯罪网络。

Method: CORE-KG采用两步流程：类型感知的共指消解和领域引导的实体关系提取，基于改进的GraphRAG框架。

Result: 与基线相比，CORE-KG减少了33.28%的节点重复和38.37%的法律噪声，生成更清晰的知识图谱。

Conclusion: CORE-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了大型语言模型（LLMs）推理过程及输出的系统性比较，尤其是在自我反思模式（“顿悟时刻”）和跨领域关联方面。

Method: 采用关键词统计和LLM-as-a-judge范式，结合多样化的现实场景问题数据集，评估推理连贯性和输出准确性。

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在多模态时间序列预测中，文本信息的作用及其适用条件，发现其效果并非普遍适用，并提出了建模和数据方面的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在多模态时间序列预测中，文本信息是否以及在何种条件下能带来一致的性能提升。

Method: 通过14个预测任务的多样化基准测试，评估了基于对齐和基于提示的两种多模态预测方法。

Result: 多模态方法的效果因数据集和模型而异，有时甚至不如单模态基线。文本信息的有效性取决于模型架构和数据特性。

Conclusion: 文本信息在特定条件下（如高容量文本模型、互补预测信号等）对预测任务有帮助，但并非普遍适用。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

TL;DR: 论文提出AdaptGOT模型，结合自适应表示学习和地理-共现-文本表示，解决POI嵌入中的多上下文采样和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POI嵌入方法在多上下文采样、泛化性和多功能性方面存在不足。

Method: AdaptGOT模型包含上下文邻域生成、增强的GOT表示和MoE自适应编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在多个真实数据集和POI任务上验证了模型的优越性能。

Conclusion: AdaptGOT模型有效解决了POI嵌入的挑战，表现出色。

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

TL;DR: LastingBench是一个新框架，旨在通过扰动和重写泄漏点来减少大型语言模型在QA基准测试中的记忆效应，确保评估的公平性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能通过记忆任务特定数据在QA基准测试中作弊，削弱评估的有效性。现有研究多关注检测泄漏，而忽略了减轻其影响和保持基准长期效用。

Method: LastingBench通过扰动识别泄漏点，并将其重写为反事实内容，破坏模型的记忆同时保留基准的评估意图。

Result: 评估显示，LastingBench显著减少了记忆效应，揭示了现有QA基准的性能差距。

Conclusion: LastingBench提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，确保基准的长期鲁棒性，促进对LLM更公平和可解释的评估。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

TL;DR: GARMLE-G框架通过检索权威临床指南内容，生成与临床实践一致的医疗建议，避免了传统方法的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗语言模型依赖ICD代码，无法捕捉临床医生的复杂推理过程，限制了模型的临床实用性。

Method: GARMLE-G结合LLM预测和EHR数据生成查询，通过嵌入相似性检索CPG内容，并将其与模型输出融合。

Result: 在高血压诊断的原型系统中，GARMLE-G在检索精度、语义相关性和指南依从性上优于RAG基线。

Conclusion: GARMLE-G提供了一种可扩展、低成本且无幻觉的方法，为医疗语言模型提供了基于证据的临床实践支持。

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TIM的大规模时间线智能模型，用于解决开放领域时间线摘要（TLS）中主题相关性和时间准确性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本新闻摘要和时间戳定位方面表现良好，但在评估主题相关性和理解主题演变方面存在困难，导致摘要信息不准确或包含无关细节。

Method: 提出TIM模型，采用渐进优化策略：首先通过指令调优提升摘要和信息过滤能力，然后利用双对齐奖励学习方法从语义和时间角度改进对主题演变的理解。

Result: TIM在开放领域实验中表现出强大的时间线摘要能力。

Conclusion: TIM是首个针对开放领域TLS的大规模模型，通过渐进优化策略显著提升了摘要性能。

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

TL;DR: IndexTTS2提出了一种新的自回归模型友好的语音时长控制方法，支持两种生成模式，并实现了情感表达与说话人身份的分离控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归TTS模型在语音时长控制上的局限性，尤其是在需要严格音视频同步的应用中。

Method: 提出两种生成模式：显式指定生成令牌数以精确控制时长，或自由生成语音并保留输入提示的韵律特征。结合GPT潜在表示增强稳定性，并设计基于文本描述的软指令机制。

Result: 在零样本设置下，IndexTTS2在词错误率、说话人相似性和情感保真度上优于现有最先进的TTS模型。

Conclusion: IndexTTS2通过创新的时长控制和情感分离方法，显著提升了TTS模型的性能和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治相关在线讨论中的表现及其潜在影响。

Method: 通过三个实验，让GPT-4模拟真实或虚构的党派用户生成评论，分析政治倾向、情感和语言特征。

Result: GPT-4能生成真实评论，但更易形成共识；人工与生成评论在语义空间可区分。

Conclusion: LLMs可能被用于操纵在线政治讨论，需警惕AI驱动的叙事影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Conclusion: OPC为数学证明生成研究提供了重要资源，并展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading

TL;DR: 论文通过信息论视角提出一个探测框架，评估显式结构建模对语言模型表示的作用，并探索MLPs作为GNNs高效替代方案的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现GNNs未能充分利用结构信息，而MLPs在结构感知任务中表现出色，因此探索MLPs是否可作为GNNs的替代方案。

Method: 提出模块化探测框架，分离GNN的消息传递和特征转换操作，评估其对语言模型表示的影响。

Result: MLPs作为特征转换模块能有效提升语言模型表示的语言知识，而仅依赖消息传递的模型表现较差。

Conclusion: MLPs在结构建模中具有潜力，可作为GNNs的高效替代方案，特征转换操作对模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation

message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative

*Swastika Kundu,Autoshi Ibrahim,Mithila Rahman,Tanvir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ANUBHUTI是一个包含2000句孟加拉语方言的标注数据集，用于情感分析，填补了低资源方言研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语言多样性和标注数据有限，孟加拉语方言的情感分析研究不足。

Method: 数据集包含政治、宗教和中性文本，采用多类主题标注和多标签情感标注，由专家翻译和标注，并通过质量检查确保一致性。

Result: 数据集质量高，标注一致性强，填补了资源空白。

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI为低资源孟加拉语方言的情感分析提供了重要资源，提升了自然语言处理的准确性。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

TL;DR: 研究揭示了自监督语音Transformer中与说话者信息相关的神经元，并通过保护这些神经元在剪枝过程中显著保留了说话者相关任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音Transformer如何编码说话者信息，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 分析前馈层中与k-means聚类和i-vectors相关的神经元，识别与说话者信息相关的神经元。

Result: 发现这些神经元对应广泛的语音和性别类别，适合用于识别说话者信息。

Conclusion: 保护这些神经元在剪枝过程中至关重要，能显著保留说话者相关任务的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动事实核查系统中的知识偏见影响，发现Llama 3.1在直接提示下对近半数声明标记为“证据不足”，且生成支持性文档时存在固有负面偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs中的参数知识偏见如何影响事实核查系统的结果，尤其是HerO系统在FEVER-25基准中的表现。

Method: 通过两种实验：(1) 分析Llama 3.1的参数知识偏见；(2) 故意注入偏见并观察对检索结果的影响。

Result: Llama 3.1对半数声明无法给出明确结论；生成支持性文档时存在负面偏见，但最终预测结果在不同提示策略下保持稳定。

Conclusion: LLMs在事实核查中存在知识偏见，需谨慎设计提示策略以减少偏见影响。

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为TLQA的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在时间引用列表问答任务中的表现，揭示了当前模型在完整性和时间对齐方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间理解任务中容易产生幻觉和错误，现有研究未充分评估模型在列表答案构建中的时间理解能力。

Method: 提出TLQA基准测试，要求模型生成与时间对齐的列表格式答案，并在闭卷和开放域设置下评估模型表现。

Result: 研究发现当前模型在闭卷设置中难以提供完整答案和时间对齐的事实，开放域设置中检索能力有待改进。

Conclusion: TLQA基准为未来研究提供了明确方向，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

### [139] [Offensive Language Detection on Social Media Using XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21795)
*Reem Alothman,Hafida Benhidour,Said Kerrache*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于XLNet的自动检测社交媒体上攻击性语言的模型，并与BERT进行了性能比较，结果显示XLNet在检测攻击性内容方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上攻击性内容（如仇恨言论、种族主义等）的增加需要自动化检测系统，而深度学习模型（尤其是迁移学习）在自然语言处理中表现出色。

Method: 使用XLNet和BERT模型，基于Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID)进行评估，并采用过采样和欠采样策略处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: XLNet在检测攻击性内容和分类攻击类型上优于BERT，而BERT在识别攻击目标上略优。过采样和欠采样策略有效提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 迁移学习和XLNet架构在构建鲁棒的社交媒体攻击性语言检测系统中具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

describe a suite of programmatic tools for rendering allotaxonographs for
rank-turbulence divergence in Matlab, Javascript, and Python, all of which have
different use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策过程缺乏透明性，限制了其在高风险领域的应用，因此需要系统化的可解释性方法。

Method: 通过分类（编码器、解码器、编码器-解码器架构）综述XAI方法，并评估其解释能力及实际应用。

Result: 总结了现有XAI技术的分类、评估方法和应用场景，揭示了研究挑战和未来方向。

Conclusion: 需继续开发透明且负责任的LLMs，当前研究为未来工作提供了系统化指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了科学英语中词汇频率的突然变化，发现这些变化主要由语义和语用因素驱动，而非简单的同义词替换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）如何影响科学英语的词汇使用，特别是频率突增的词汇是否取代同义词或反映更广泛的语义变化。

Method: 通过PubMed科学摘要的频率趋势分析同义词组，并结合词性标注量化语法类别的语言变化。

Result: 发现语义集群整体变化，表明语言模型的影响主要是语义和语用的；形容词“important”使用显著下降。

Conclusion: 语言技术对科学英语的影响更多体现在语义和语用层面，而非纯粹的词汇替换。

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多输入神经网络框架，结合语言编码器和领域特定特征，用于波斯古典诗歌的作者归属，取得了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯古典诗歌的语言、风格和韵律复杂性对计算作者归属提出了挑战，需要一种综合方法。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的语言编码器，结合语义、风格和韵律特征，对647,653节诗歌进行预处理和验证。

Result: 加权投票方案达到71%准确率，高置信度预测（0.9阈值）可达97%准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为波斯诗歌的作者归属和风格分析提供了有效工具，支持多语言作者归属和生成建模的进一步研究。

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在NLP中的黑盒性和计算效率问题，提出一种可解释且高效的替代方案。

Method: 整合五种语言特征（词汇、句法、实体级、词级语义和文档级语义）于逻辑回归模型中。

Result: 在20 Newsgroups数据集上达到84.89%的准确率，比TF-IDF基线高3.32%。

Conclusion: LinguaSynth为可解释且高效的NLP模型设定了新标准，挑战了深度学习模型在文本分类中的必要性。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）输出置信度的估计方法，提出了基于生成一致性的假设（一致性假设），并通过统计测试和任务评估验证其有效性，最终提出了一种无数据的黑盒不确定性量化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要高用户信任的实际应用中，准确估计LLM输出的置信度至关重要。黑盒不确定性量化方法因其仅需模型API访问而受到欢迎，但其背后的假设（生成一致性作为置信度代理）尚未充分验证。

Method: 论文提出了三个数学陈述及统计测试，形式化了一致性假设的变体，并通过8个基准数据集和3个任务（问答、文本摘要和文本到SQL）进行实证研究。

Result: 研究发现，一致性假设在不同设置下普遍成立，其中‘Sim-Any’假设最具可操作性。基于此，论文提出的无数据黑盒UQ方法在置信度估计上表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 论文验证了一致性假设的实用性，并展示了其在黑盒不确定性量化中的实际价值，为LLM输出的置信度估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Motivation: 探究神经语言模型如何在不同层中构建句法结构，尤其是微观和宏观结构的形成过程。

Method: 使用Derivational Probing方法分析BERT模型中词嵌入在不同层的传播过程，重点关注微观和宏观句法结构的构建。

Result: 实验发现微观结构在低层形成，逐渐整合为宏观结构；宏观结构的构建时机对下游任务性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了BERT模型中句法结构的构建过程，并指出全局句法信息整合的最佳时机。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

Motivation: 解决原生MLLMs因配对语音-文本数据不足导致的灾难性遗忘和性能下降问题。

Method: 采用专家混合（MoE）架构，自适应区分模态专家，进行单模态训练和多模态协作训练。

Result: 性能下降仅5.5%，优于原生MLLMs的20%下降，对话延迟保持在0.5秒内。

Conclusion: DeepTalk在保持低延迟的同时显著提升了性能，为智能语音交互提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

Method: 提出两阶段评估框架（感知与预测），设计WM-ABench基准，覆盖23个细粒度维度，并在6个模拟环境中进行660次实验。

Result: VLMs在基础世界建模能力上表现不佳，例如运动轨迹区分接近随机准确率，且存在偏见（如认为蓝色物体移动更快）。

Conclusion: VLMs与人类水平的世界建模能力存在显著差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

### [150] [A Dual-Layered Evaluation of Geopolitical and Cultural Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21881)
*Sean Kim,Hyuhng Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过两阶段评估定义并分析了LLMs中的模型偏见和推理偏见，揭示了查询语言对模型输出的影响，并提出了多语言环境下评估LLM行为的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在不同语言和文化背景下的行为，尤其是在其输出可能影响公众观点或强化主导叙事的情况下。

Method: 两阶段评估：阶段1评估LLMs在事实性问题上的表现，阶段2探讨地缘政治敏感争议中的模型行为。构建了一个多语言、多类型的手动标注数据集。

Result: 阶段1显示查询语言导致模型输出对齐，阶段2反映了模型训练背景与查询语言的交互作用。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一个评估LLM行为的结构化框架，为未来多语言环境下的LLM部署和文化意识评估提供了见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

*Ernie Chang,Yang Li,Patrick Huber,David Kant,Yangyang Shi,Vikas Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用训练过程中的检查点模型来优化数据混合的方法，通过评估不同检查点的能力并聚合其一阶影响，显著提升了预训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言模型训练中，如何直接获取适合不同任务的数据混合物是一个挑战，因为数据与任务之间的关系难以建模。

Method: 通过观察训练轨迹中检查点模型的能力，识别并利用这些检查点作为数据混合器，聚合其一阶影响近似来优化数据混合物。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，该方法在预训练设置中表现出显著改进，性能提升高达1.93%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，检查点模型具有优化数据质量和混合的潜力。

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为PapersPlease的基准测试，通过3700个道德困境评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在优先处理人类需求时的决策行为，发现LLMs存在隐含偏好和对社会身份的不同响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs在角色扮演场景中的表现和偏见，尤其是在处理人类需求时的决策行为。

Method: 方法是通过构建基于ERG理论的道德困境，让LLMs扮演移民检查员，根据短篇叙述决定是否批准入境。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在决策中存在统计显著的偏好，且对社会身份的响应因需求和身份线索而异，部分模型对边缘化身份的拒绝率更高。

Conclusion: 结论是LLMs在道德决策中表现出隐含偏好，且社会身份对其决策有显著影响，数据已公开。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

TL;DR: 研究评估了工具集成LLM代理的稳定性，发现其在工具调用的各个阶段易出错，开源模型更脆弱，增大模型规模未必提升稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注端到端工具使用，忽视稳定性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过实验分析代理在工具调用各阶段的错误易感性，比较开源与专有模型的差异。

Result: 代理在各阶段易出错，开源模型更脆弱，增大模型规模未显著改善稳定性。

Conclusion: 强调评估代理稳定性的重要性，为未来LLM开发和评估提供见解。

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种混合方法（GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame），结合令牌级和提示级攻击技术，显著提高了对预训练语言模型的越狱成功率，并揭示了现有安全措施的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型（PTLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，但其安全性仍易受攻击。现有攻击方法（令牌级和提示级）各有局限性，需结合两者以提升攻击效果。

Method: 提出两种混合攻击方法：GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame，结合令牌级和提示级技术，评估了它们在Vicuna和Llama模型上的表现。

Result: GCG + PAIR在未防御模型上的攻击成功率（ASR）达91.6%，显著高于PAIR的58.4%；GCG + WordGame保持高ASR（>80%），并能突破高级防御措施。

Conclusion: 混合攻击方法揭示了现有安全措施的漏洞，强调了对抗适应性攻击时需采取更全面的防护措施。

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用大语言模型（LLMs）模拟社交网络用户行为的可行性，并提出了一个验证模拟结果实证真实性的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有研究对LLMs是否能替代人类进行实证研究存在分歧，需要更好地理解实验设计的差异。

Method: 提出了一个社交网络模拟的正式框架，并测试了模仿用户在X平台上英语和德语交流的不同方法。

Result: 研究发现，社交模拟应通过其拟合场景中的实证真实性进行验证。

Conclusion: 论文主张在基于生成代理的社会模拟中应更加严谨。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在通用领域表现优异，但在驾驶舱等特定领域（如多语言和专业词汇）表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 收集驾驶舱模拟器和飞行员访谈录音，手动标注数据，提出规范化方案，并采用LoRA进行高效微调。

Result: WER从68.49%（预训练模型）降至26.26%（微调后模型）。

Conclusion: 规范化方案和微调显著提升了Whisper模型在驾驶舱对话转录中的性能。

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

Motivation: 比较机器翻译与人工翻译在儿童文学翻译中的表现，探索LLM在CLT中的潜力。

Method: 构建包含21种翻译的语料库，使用通用和特定特征集进行风格计量分析，并应用机器学习分类与聚类技术。

Result: HT与MT在通用特征上差异显著，LLM在特定特征上表现优于NMT，风格更接近HT。

Conclusion: LLM在儿童文学翻译中展现出潜力，尤其在风格上与人工翻译更为接近。

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

Method: 构建包含4个子语料库的数据集，采用五层特征集，并应用卡方排名算法进行特征选择。

Result: 原始中文文本与LLM/NMT输出区分度高；MT输出句子更短，使用更多转折连词；LLM与NMT分类准确率约70%。

Conclusion: LLM和NMT在MTese表现上有差异，但中外LLM无明显区别。

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在复杂推理方面取得了进展，但其在长链推理中的自我修正能力仍未充分研究，且存在冗余推理问题。

Method: 通过实证研究发现，推理的第一步对最终预测影响巨大，并提出了一种基于奖励模型的采样策略，以优化第一步推理。

Result: 该方法在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen3模型上实现了推理成本降低70%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了新的基准测试，为未来研究LLMs的鲁棒推理能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字平台的社会语言学动态，深化了对在线空间中语言如何反映意识形态和社会结构的理解。

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

Result: 仅需少量网络组件即可完成基础任务，但复杂场景需要更多组件。

Conclusion: GPT-2 Small中主谓一致功能由特定子网络实现，且其效率与任务复杂度相关。

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

Method: 通过三步数据整理流程构建数据集，使用IPC代码进行领域标注，并包含明确的关联判断。

Result: 数据集包含49,869个评估对，基线实验显示跨领域专利检索存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: DAPFAM为专利检索提供了高质量、易用的数据集，支持跨领域研究。

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now

Conclusion: 提出的方法在阿拉伯语-英语CS任务上超越了大规模多语言模型，性能显著提升。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

Motivation: 探索哪种批评类型最有效以改进模型响应，并研究如何生成此类批评。

Method: 引入RCO框架，利用改进信号训练批评模型，通过反馈循环优化响应。

Result: 在五个任务中，RCO显著优于传统方法和开源模型。

Conclusion: RCO有效提升了大语言模型的批评-改进循环，贡献包括新监督方案和实验验证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

*Patrick Haller,Jannis Vamvas,Rico Sennrich,Lena A. Jäger*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的评估方法QM，利用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，提高了基于问题的偏见评估的稳定性，并发现指令调优可能改变偏见方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法评估LLMs政治偏见时稳定性不足，难以可靠比较模型。

Method: 提出QM任务，使用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，评估模型偏见。

Result: QM提高了评估稳定性，发现指令调优可能改变偏见方向，且大模型能更有效利用上下文示例。

Conclusion: QM为偏见评估提供了更稳定的方法，并揭示了模型大小与偏见表现的关系。

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

*Albert Agisha Ntwali,Luca Rück,Martin Heckmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GPT-4o的新方法，利用上下文信息检测结构化数据中的个人数据，并在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CASSED和Microsoft Presidio）在检测个人数据时未充分利用上下文信息，限制了其性能。

Method: 结合特征名称、值、其他特征名称和数据集描述等上下文信息，利用GPT-4o进行检测。

Result: 在MIMIC-Demo-Ext等真实数据集上表现优异，尤其在Kaggle和OpenML数据集中，上下文信息显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: 未来研究需要更多包含个人信息的真实数据集以推动技术进步。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM作为评估者时存在的评分偏见，提出了一个评估框架，并通过实验展示了偏见对评分稳定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估者（LLM-as-a-Judge）在复杂任务中表现优异，但其评分存在偏见，影响公平性和可靠性。目前研究多集中于基于比较的评估，对基于评分的偏见研究较少。

Method: 定义了评分偏见，设计了综合评估框架，通过数据合成扩展现有基准数据集，并设计多维度评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，现有评估模型的评分稳定性受偏见影响。进一步实验为评分提示模板设计和偏见缓解提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM-as-a-Judge中的评分偏见问题，为未来设计和缓解偏见提供了方向。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人类语言理解中随机解析策略的有效性，通过实验调整验证其在高复杂度输入下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类语言理解并非随机解析，但先前研究表明随机策略在高准确率下仍可行，研究旨在验证其局限性。

Method: 通过使用更复杂的层次结构输入和引入与意外性相关的目标函数，评估随机解析策略的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，随机解析策略在高复杂度输入下可能难以维持高准确率。

Conclusion: 随机解析策略在特定条件下可能有效，但在更接近人类语言理解的复杂场景中表现受限。

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

TL;DR: QuickSilver是一个无需更改模型权重或结构的推理优化框架，通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合机制，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的推理阶段占用了大部分延迟和能耗，现有方法需要重新训练或架构调整，限制了实用性。

Method: QuickSilver通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合三种机制，在推理时实现语义适应性优化。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama-2上测试，QuickSilver最高减少39.6%的FLOP，且困惑度仅轻微增加（≤0.2）。

Conclusion: QuickSilver为LLM推理提供了一种高效、兼容的优化方案，无需修改模型本身。

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

Abstract: We present a grammar error correction (GEC) system that achieves state of the
art for the Czech language. Our system is based on a neural network translation
approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its
real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences
with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific
errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert
fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in
performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为韩语AI创新提供强大基础，并成为全球研究社区的宝贵资源。

Method: 采用Peri-LN Transformer架构，分三阶段预训练，扩展上下文窗口至128K token，并通过监督微调和强化学习优化。

Result: 在韩国基准测试中表现优异，双语一致性和翻译质量良好，视觉增强版甚至超越GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: HyperCLOVA X THINK是韩语AI领域的突破，未来将通过剪枝和蒸馏技术进一步优化。

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language
model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion
high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模拟真实临床诊断过程的基准测试（Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark）和模型无关的诊断协调器（MAI-DxO），显著提高了诊断准确性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型的评估方法未能反映真实临床诊断的复杂性和动态性，限制了AI在医学领域的应用潜力。

Method: 通过将304个NEJM-CPC病例转化为逐步诊断任务，引入MAI-DxO协调器模拟医生团队，动态选择高价值测试。

Result: MAI-DxO与OpenAI o3模型结合时，诊断准确率达80%，成本降低20%（相比医生）和70%（相比普通模型）。

Conclusion: AI系统通过迭代思考和策略性行动，可显著提升临床诊断的精确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

*Hanti Lin*

Main category: stat.OT

TL;DR: 本文呼吁整合统计学与机器学习的历史和哲学，提出了一种称为“可实现主义”的基础假设，并通过案例研究展示了其方法论意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，人工智能的成功很大程度上依赖于机器学习，而机器学习与统计学的关系日益模糊。因此，整合历史和哲学以及统计学与机器学习的需求变得迫切。

Method: 通过案例研究，追溯哲学思想在机器学习和形式认识论中的根源，并结合历史和哲学与形式认识论的方法论。

Result: 提出了“可实现主义”这一基础假设，揭示了频率统计与机器学习实践中的共同隐含前提。

Conclusion: 通过双重整合（历史与哲学、统计学与机器学习）和方法论结合，为相关领域提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: The integration of the history and philosophy of statistics was initiated at
least by Hacking (1965) and advanced by Mayo (1996), but it has not received
sustained follow-up. Yet such integration is more urgent than ever, as the
recent success of artificial intelligence has been driven largely by machine
learning -- a field historically developed alongside statistics. Today, the
boundary between statistics and machine learning is increasingly blurred. What
we now need is integration, twice over: of history and philosophy, and of the
field they engage -- statistics and machine learning. I present a case study of
a philosophical idea in machine learning (and in formal epistemology) whose
root can be traced back to an often under-appreciated insight in Neyman and
Pearson's 1936 work (a follow-up to their 1933 classic). This leads to the
articulation of a foundational assumption -- largely implicit in, but shared
by, the practices of frequentist statistics and machine learning -- which I
call achievabilism. Another integration also emerges at the level of
methodology, combining two ends of the philosophy of science spectrum: history
and philosophy of science on the one hand, and formal epistemology on the other
hand.

TL;DR: DiffSoundStream通过结合语义令牌和潜在扩散模型，提高了语音令牌化的效率，在较低令牌率下实现高质量语音生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音令牌化中，令牌率限制了推理速度，且语义和声学令牌间存在冗余。

Method: 1. 通过语义令牌条件化神经编解码器减少冗余；2. 利用潜在扩散模型从语义和粗粒度声学令牌合成高质量波形。

Result: 在50令牌/秒下，语音质量与标准SoundStream（100令牌/秒）相当，且仅需4步扩散采样即可实现步长蒸馏。

Conclusion: DiffSoundStream在低令牌率下实现了高效且高质量的语音生成。

Abstract: Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation,
where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning
(SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred
to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled
autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate.
In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the
efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two
techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize
redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent
diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and
coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second,
DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream
model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size
distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality
loss.

Result: 在Open Research Knowledge Graph平台上实现，初步实验显示该方法简化了预处理，减少了语义化工作量，并提升了知识表示质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为科学知识的语义化表示提供了可行路径，增强了知识的可发现性和重用性。

Abstract: Scientific publications, primarily digitized as PDFs, remain static and
unstructured, limiting the accessibility and reusability of the contained
knowledge. At best, scientific knowledge from publications is provided in
tabular formats, which lack semantic context. A more flexible, structured, and
semantic representation is needed to make scientific knowledge understandable
and processable by both humans and machines. We propose an evolution model of
knowledge representation, inspired by the 5-star Linked Open Data (LOD) model,
with five stages and defined criteria to guide the stepwise transition from a
digital artifact, such as a PDF, to a semantic representation integrated in a
knowledge graph (KG). Based on an exemplary workflow implementing the entire
model, we developed a hybrid approach, called SciMantify, leveraging tabular
formats of scientific knowledge, e.g., results from secondary studies, to
support its evolving semantification. In the approach, humans and machines
collaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining
the results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific
knowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph
(ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility,
interoperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge. A preliminary user
experiment showed that the approach simplifies the preprocessing of scientific
knowledge, reduces the effort for the evolving semantification, and enhances
the knowledge representation through better alignment with the KG structures.

Conclusion: QML的安全需要平衡噪声与可靠性，开发量子-经典信任框架，以应对不断演变的对抗性威胁。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical
machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative
tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in
the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines
adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in
cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models.
Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output
extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse
engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks.
Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured
QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership,
and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter
these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive
watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies
disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial
training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing
vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures.
However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing
noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks,
and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes
recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and
practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving
adversarial landscapes.

Conclusion: 该研究为设计稳健的量子机器提供了理论基础，适用于近量子硬件的混沌时间序列预测。

Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their
recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and
forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and
interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the
reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words,
quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems.
Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and
their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and
geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is
enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by
leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for
designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion
$GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We
analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we
analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise
enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications
on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens
opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series
forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.

Motivation: 探索Kolmogorov Arnold Networks（KANs）在量子机器学习中的潜力，利用其表达复杂函数的优势。

Method: 实现混合和完全量子形式的KAN架构，使用量子电路Born机器（QCBM），并利用预训练残差函数进行转换。

Result: 展示了QuKAN架构的可行性、可解释性和性能。

Conclusion: QuKAN架构为量子机器学习提供了一种新的高效方法。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the

Abstract: The Yellow River is China's mother river and a cradle of human civilization.
The ancient Yellow River culture is, moreover, an indispensable part of human
art history. To conserve and inherit the ancient Yellow River culture, we
designed RiverEcho, a real-time interactive system that responds to voice

Motivation: 目前ML在无线网络中的反馈压缩研究多基于模拟，缺乏实际场景验证，且设备间无法共享ML模型。

Method: 开发了一种保密训练互操作ML模型的方法，并在原型UE和基站上测试其性能。

Result: 实验表明，无需共享ML模型即可实现高精度的信道反馈，并提升下行链路吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该研究为6G网络中ML信道反馈的实际应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Neural network-based compression and decompression of channel state feedback
has been one of the most widely studied applications of machine learning (ML)
in wireless networks. Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based
feedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel
information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life
proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback
compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base
station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML
models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing
models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based
channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed
channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the
channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results
demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel
feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network
vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based
channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.

TL;DR: MELP是一种多尺度ECG-语言预训练模型，通过分层监督从ECG-文本对中学习，显著提升ECG分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖大规模人工标注，耗时耗力；自监督学习虽为替代方案，但未能捕捉ECG信号的多尺度特性。

Method: MELP结合心脏学专用语言模型和三层次跨模态监督（令牌、节拍、节律），对齐ECG信号与文本报告。

Result: 在多个ECG数据集上，MELP在零样本分类、线性探测和迁移学习任务中优于现有自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: MELP通过多尺度监督有效学习ECG的层次结构，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and
diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for
ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both
time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,
self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling
the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently
transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored
SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail
to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods
struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model
the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP,
a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages
hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a
cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical
text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token,
beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing
structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three
public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG
classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its
effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code
is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/MELP.

Abstract: Recent research works establish deep neural networks as high performing tools
for radar target detection, especially on challenging environments (presence of
clutter or interferences, multi-target scenarii...). However, the usually large
computational complexity of these networks is one of the factors preventing
them from being widely implemented in embedded radar systems. We propose to
investigate novel neural architecture search (NAS) methods, based on
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for finding neural networks achieving the
required detection performance and striving towards a lower computational
complexity. We evaluate the searched architectures on endoclutter radar
signals, in order to compare their respective performance metrics and
generalization properties. A novel network satisfying the required detection
probability while being significantly lighter than the expert-designed baseline
is proposed.

Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key
frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving
high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them
to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint.
Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation
approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate
geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a
transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for
simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic
calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism
now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced
substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is
the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate
showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular
imaging calorimeter systems.

Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal
neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights
into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological
compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This
review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological
characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare
sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting
species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review
both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans.
Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined,
including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based
preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we
discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth
restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive
foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal
sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in
prenatal care.

Motivation: 研究人脸对齐中误差分布的偏差问题，发现误差沿切线方向分布，提出利用这一特性优化CNN模型收敛。

Method: 提出各向异性方向损失（ADL）和各向异性注意力模块（AAM），分别用于坐标和热图回归，结合为ADNet训练框架。

Result: ADNet在300W、WFLW和COFW数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ADL和AAM互补学习人脸结构和纹理细节，验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

Result: 在密集300W测试集及原始稀疏300W和WFLW测试集上均达到了最先进的精度。

Conclusion: 该框架无需额外成本即可提升密集和稀疏地标的对齐精度，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though
dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic
medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical
insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface.
These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection,
resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance,
current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic
map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of
cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map,
managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific
knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses
the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and
analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent
designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules:
Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI),
and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the
interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts
as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze
questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall
score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o.

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得竞争性FID分数，但反映记忆问题；LCH假设验证局部相关性对生成能力的影响。

Conclusion: MESP和LCH框架揭示了概率生成模型的局限性，局部相关性可能提升生成能力。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM

results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this

advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the
total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse
historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations,
advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma

unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical
utility.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep

pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor是一种无需训练的令牌压缩策略，专为视频多模态大语言模型设计。通过语义连通组件（SCC）方法，实现全面的语义覆盖，并在时空域中进行令牌压缩，显著优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于注意力分数压缩令牌，但无法有效捕捉所有语义区域且易导致冗余。

Method: 提出SCC方法，将令牌分配到不同的语义区域，形成两步时空令牌压缩策略。

Result: 在多种视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在低令牌保留率下。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor通过SCC实现了高效的令牌压缩，提升了视频多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token剪枝方法在多模态大语言模型中显著削弱了视觉定位能力，导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP)，通过调整位置ID来恢复剪枝后的性能。

Result: GAP将LLaVA在RefCOCO验证集上的准确率从剪枝后的15.34%恢复至51.42%，接近原始性能的90%。

Conclusion: GAP方法无需额外训练或计算开销，能有效提升多种token剪枝策略下的模型性能。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

Motivation: 随着点云数据应用的普及，检测OOD点云对象对模型安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有研究对此问题探索不足。

Result: SODA在多种数据集和问题设置中表现优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SODA有效解决了合成数据与真实数据之间的域偏移问题，提升了OOD点云检测的性能。

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割面临类别差异、遮挡和物体尺寸变化的挑战，需要深度学习模型学习鲁棒特征并生成足够的特征描述符。

Method: 采用两个堆叠的编码器-解码器网络和扩张残差块（DRB）来捕获长距离语义并保留空间信息。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上的实验表明，SDRNet在语义分割中表现优异。

Conclusion: SDRNet能够有效解决高分辨率遥感图像语义分割中的挑战，性能优于现有深度卷积神经网络。

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1在空间推理任务上表现优异，同时保持通用任务竞争力。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance
clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

Motivation: ADNet在背景建模和适应性方面存在不足，TPM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: TPM绑定前景和背景分布的原型位置，支持多原型和多类分割，并利用类先验定义自适应阈值。

Result: TPM显著提高了分割准确性。

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了新的原型建模视角。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉推理中存在绑定问题，即难以可靠地将感知特征与正确的视觉对象关联，导致在计数、视觉搜索等任务中表现不佳。

Method: 通过为视觉输入添加低级空间结构（如水平线），并结合鼓励序列化、空间感知解析的文本提示。

Result: 方法显著提升了视觉推理任务的表现：GPT-4o视觉搜索准确率提升25.00%，计数准确率提升26.83%，场景描述编辑距离误差减少0.32，空间关系任务性能提升9.50%。

Conclusion: 低级的视觉结构调整是提升视觉语言模型性能的有效方向，优于纯语言策略，强调了视觉输入设计的重要性。

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Conclusion: 频率增强的语义特征能显著提升零样本动作识别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Conclusion: RoomCraft通过多阶段优化和冲突感知策略，有效解决了3D室内场景生成的挑战。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Result: 模型会根据对象与场景的语义相关性和噪声水平动态调整对上下文的依赖。

Conclusion: VLMs能动态平衡局部和上下文信息，尤其在目标与场景高度一致或对象退化时更依赖上下文。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Motivation: 灾后建筑损坏的快速识别对应急响应至关重要，但传统光学卫星图像常受云层或缺乏灾前数据的限制。

Method: 整合SAR图像、OSM建筑足迹、DSM数据和GEM属性，构建多模态深度学习模型，仅使用灾后数据。

Result: 在土耳其2023年地震数据集上验证，显示结合地理空间特征显著提升了检测性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Motivation: 事件相机适合动态环境（如无人机和自动驾驶），但传统深度学习模型在其上的性能尚不明确。

Method: 在GEN1事件数据集上微调ResNet34和ViT B16，并在标准条件和模拟噪声下评估。

Result: ResNet34和ViT B16在干净数据集上分别达到88%和86%的准确率，ViT B16在噪声下更稳健。

Conclusion: 研究为无人机等动态环境中的事件视觉系统提供了有前景的方法和结果。

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision
Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes,
unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE)任务，旨在提升视频大模型在动态推理中的能力，通过分类和生成任务解决抽象推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大模型在抽象和动态推理方面表现不足，无法根据新信息调整结论。DVidE任务旨在模拟现实场景中结论随证据变化的情况。

Method: 分类任务采用Chain of Counterfactual Thought框架，结合反事实推理和ASR增强视频内容；生成任务结合ASR输出和LLM生成上下文相关的更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法显著提升了模型的动态推理能力。

Conclusion: DVidE任务及相关框架有效增强了视频大模型在动态推理中的表现，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过对抗性攻击误导视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成错误标注，从而污染文本到图像生成模型的训练数据，实验证明攻击效果显著且防御困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在文本到图像生成模型的训练中起关键作用，但其易受对抗性攻击，可能导致训练数据污染。

Method: 通过对抗性扰动攻击VLMs，生成看似正常但标注错误的图像-文本对，注入到训练数据中。

Result: 攻击成功率高（超过73%），即使对商业VLMs（如Google Vertex AI和Microsoft Azure）也有效。

Conclusion: 对抗性攻击对VLMs的威胁显著，可能导致训练数据质量下降和开发成本增加，防御措施易被绕过。

Abstract: Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images
sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical
for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs
during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to
stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to
images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions.
  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks
on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image
models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to
adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images
that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of
injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for
text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number
of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective,
they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a
cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and
increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate
the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success
(over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex
AI and Microsoft Azure).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态分块自回归合成框架（DCAR），通过动态调整分块预测范围，显著提升了语音合成的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归语音合成模型在处理长语音序列时存在稳定性和延迟问题，限制了实时应用的可行性。

Method: DCAR引入了分块到帧的注意力机制，通过多令牌预测训练，动态调整令牌预测范围。

Result: 实验表明，DCAR在测试集上实现了72.27%的可懂度提升和2.61倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: DCAR为下一代语音合成系统提供了一个高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as a dominant
approach in speech synthesis, offering expressive generation and scalable
training. However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the
next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when
handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable
frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis
quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise
autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both
efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR
introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with
multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech
contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts
the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length
dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional
next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility
improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile
foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.

Conclusion: 神经网络在MIDI与音频对齐任务中具有潜力，可推动技术发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio
recordings of human piano performances with their corresponding loosely aligned
MIDI files. The task is addressed using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network (CRNN) architecture, which effectively captures spectral and temporal
features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to
estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of
piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing
errors. The proposed model achieves up to 20% higher alignment accuracy than
the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various
tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional
improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of neural networks in advancing state-of-the-art
MIDI-to-audio alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法未考虑耳戴设备的低功耗实现，如采样频率和比特分辨率对语音质量和功耗的影响，以及无需GAN的音频质量提升。

Method: SUBARU采用子奈奎斯特采样和低比特分辨率，引入多尺度虚拟判别器，实现高质量音频和低功耗处理。

Conclusion: SUBARU在低功耗下实现了高质量的语音增强，适用于实际耳戴设备应用。

Abstract: Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction
microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables
as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy
conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical
aspects for low-power implementations on hearables: (i) They do not explore how
lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and
multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't
discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN
discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at
sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband
reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU
(\textbf{Sub}-Nyquist \textbf{A}udio \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{U}psampling),
which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist
sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power
consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual
discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs'
adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile
platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of
1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.

Conclusion: 改进的算法在特定场景下能更准确地预测疫情数据，为防控策略提供参考。

Abstract: Authors Yi-Cheng Chen, Ping-En Lu, Cheng-Shang Chang, and Tzu-Hsuan Liu use
the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) linear system filtering method to track and
predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19, in a
pandemic context in which there was still no vaccine and the only way to avoid
contagion was isolation. To estimate the coefficients of these FIR filters,
Chen et al. used machine learning methods through a classical optimization
problem with regularization (ridge regression). These estimated coefficients
are called ridge coefficients. The epidemic mathematical model adopted by these
researchers to formulate the FIR filters is the time-dependent discrete SIR. In
this paper, we propose a small modification to the algorithm of Chen et al. to
obtain the ridge coefficients. We then used this modified algorithm to track
and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19 in the
state of Minas Gerais/Brazil, within a prediction window, during the initial
period of the pandemic. We also compare the predicted data with the respective
real data to check how good the approximation is. In the modified algorithm, we
set values for the FIR filter orders and for the regularization parameters,
both different from the respective values defined by Chen et al. in their
algorithm. In this context, the numerical results obtained by the modified
algorithm in some simulations present better approximation errors compared to
the respective approximation errors presented by the algorithm of Chen et al.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating
high-fidelity images but typically suffer from inefficient sampling. Many
solver designs and noise scheduling strategies have been proposed to
dramatically improve sampling speeds. In this paper, we introduce a new
sampling method that is up to $186\%$ faster than the current state of the art
solver for comparative FID on ImageNet512. This new sampling method is
training-free and uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. The key
to our method resides in using higher-dimensional initial noise, allowing to
produce more detailed samples with less function evaluations from existing
pretrained diffusion models. In addition, by design our solver allows to
control the level of detail through a simple hyper-parameter at no extra
computational cost. We present how our approach leverages momentum dynamics by
establishing a fundamental equivalence between momentum diffusion models and
conventional diffusion models with respect to their training paradigms.
Moreover, we observe the use of higher-dimensional noise naturally exhibits
characteristics similar to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Finally,
we demonstrate strong performances on a set of representative pretrained
diffusion models, including EDM, EDM2, and Stable-Diffusion 3, which cover
models in both pixel and latent spaces, as well as class and text conditional
settings. The code is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-tada.

Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在可能错误时仍做出预测的问题，提供一种拒绝选项以减少错误率。

Method: 通过共形预测（CP）框架，将二元分类问题转化为带有拒绝选项的预测，并推导出错误率的理论保证。

Result: 理论分析和数值示例展示了不同CP设置下的错误率，并通过误差-拒绝曲线展示了错误率与拒绝率之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为二元分类提供了可靠的拒绝选项，帮助用户在实际应用中平衡错误率和拒绝率。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models always make a prediction, even when they are
likely to be wrong. This causes problems in practical applications, as we do
not know if we should trust a prediction. ML with reject option addresses this
issue by abstaining from making a prediction if it is likely to be incorrect.
In this work, we formalise the approach to ML with reject option in binary
classification, deriving theoretical guarantees on the resulting error rate.
This is achieved through conformal prediction (CP), which produce prediction
sets with distribution-free validity guarantees. In binary classification, CP
can output prediction sets containing exactly one, two or no labels. By
accepting only the singleton predictions, we turn CP into a binary classifier
with reject option.
  Here, CP is formally put in the framework of predicting with reject option.
We state and prove the resulting error rate, and give finite sample estimates.
Numerical examples provide illustrations of derived error rate through several
different conformal prediction settings, ranging from full conformal prediction
to offline batch inductive conformal prediction. The former has a direct link
to sharp validity guarantees, whereas the latter is more fuzzy in terms of
validity guarantees but can be used in practice. Error-reject curves illustrate
the trade-off between error rate and reject rate, and can serve to aid a user
to set an acceptable error rate or reject rate in practice.

Abstract: We propose an extension of Thompson sampling to optimization problems over
function spaces where the objective is a known functional of an unknown
operator's output. We assume that functional evaluations are inexpensive, while
queries to the operator (such as running a high-fidelity simulator) are costly.
Our algorithm employs a sample-then-optimize approach using neural operator
surrogates. This strategy avoids explicit uncertainty quantification by
treating trained neural operators as approximate samples from a Gaussian
process. We provide novel theoretical convergence guarantees, based on Gaussian
processes in the infinite-dimensional setting, under minimal assumptions. We
benchmark our method against existing baselines on functional optimization
tasks involving partial differential equations and other nonlinear
operator-driven phenomena, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and
competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合物理基础与数据驱动技术，有效解决了未配对数据问题，提供了对学习物理动力学的详细洞察。

Abstract: Physics phenomena are often described by ordinary and/or partial differential
equations (ODEs/PDEs), and solved analytically or numerically. Unfortunately,
many real-world systems are described only approximately with missing or
unknown terms in the equations. This makes the distribution of the physics
model differ from the true data-generating process (DGP). Using limited and
unpaired data between DGP observations and the imperfect model simulations, we
investigate this particular setting by completing the known-physics model,
combining theory-driven models and data-driven to describe the shifted
distribution involved in the DGP. We present a novel hybrid generative model
approach combining deep grey-box modelling with Optimal Transport (OT) methods
to enhance incomplete physics models. Our method implements OT maps in data
space while maintaining minimal source distribution distortion, demonstrating
superior performance in resolving the unpaired problem and ensuring correct
usage of physics parameters. Unlike black-box alternatives, our approach
leverages physics-based inductive biases to accurately learn system dynamics
while preserving interpretability through its domain knowledge foundation.
Experimental results validate our method's effectiveness in both generation
tasks and model transparency, offering detailed insights into learned physics
dynamics.

Abstract: Single-cell sequencing is revolutionizing biology by enabling detailed
investigations of cell-state transitions. Many biological processes unfold
along continuous trajectories, yet it remains challenging to extract smooth,
low-dimensional representations from inherently noisy, high-dimensional
single-cell data. Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP,
are widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions.
But they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading
interpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus
on separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state
transitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about
cellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build
on the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and
reproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular
NE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal
their key shortcomings, such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce
NESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE
representations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust
inference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts,
quantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to
uncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell
data. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, spanning pluripotent
stem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific
lineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields
useful biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable
cell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.

Abstract: Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important
tool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from
LLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether
entire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source
texts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we
address the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in
mixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter
in a mixture model based on \emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this
parameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone
consistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ
continuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion
parameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient
estimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased
watermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable
estimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve
these lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source
text generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed
estimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.

### [224] [Beyond ReLU: How Activations Affect Neural Kernels and Random Wide Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22429)
*David Holzmüller,Max Schölpple*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文扩展了深度学习中NTK和NNGP的理论，涵盖更多激活函数（如SELU、ELU、LeakyReLU），并分析了其RKHS特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论主要局限于ReLU激活函数，缺乏对其他常见激活函数的理解。

Method: 通过分析典型激活函数的RKHS特性，包括非光滑点为零的情况，并扩展到特殊场景（如无偏置、两层网络、多项式激活）。

Result: 发现一类非无限光滑的激活函数在不同网络深度下生成等效RKHS，而多项式激活函数生成非等效RKHS。

Conclusion: 研究为理解更广泛激活函数下的NTK和NNGP提供了理论基础，并揭示了无限宽神经网络初始化时的平滑性。

Abstract: While the theory of deep learning has made some progress in recent years,
much of it is limited to the ReLU activation function. In particular, while the
neural tangent kernel (NTK) and neural network Gaussian process kernel (NNGP)
have given theoreticians tractable limiting cases of fully connected neural
networks, their properties for most activation functions except for powers of
the ReLU function are poorly understood. Our main contribution is to provide a
more general characterization of the RKHS of these kernels for typical
activation functions whose only non-smoothness is at zero, such as SELU, ELU,
or LeakyReLU. Our analysis also covers a broad set of special cases such as
missing biases, two-layer networks, or polynomial activations. Our results show
that a broad class of not infinitely smooth activations generate equivalent
RKHSs at different network depths, while polynomial activations generate
non-equivalent RKHSs. Finally, we derive results for the smoothness of NNGP
sample paths, characterizing the smoothness of infinitely wide neural networks
at initialization.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多维环境下不可分割物品的公平分配问题，提出了弱和强sEFc两种松弛的嫉妒自由概念，并给出了存在性界限和算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂环境中多标准评估的公平分配问题，如云计算资源的多维属性。

Method: 研究弱sEFc和强sEFc两种松弛嫉妒自由概念，提供存在性界限和算法。

Result: 给出了弱和强sEFc分配的存在性界限，并证明检查弱sEF1和强sEF1分配存在性是NP难的。

Conclusion: 多维公平分配问题需要新的松弛嫉妒自由概念，算法和复杂性分析为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This paper explores the fair allocation of indivisible items in a
multidimensional setting, motivated by the need to address fairness in complex
environments where agents assess bundles according to multiple criteria. Such
multidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are
central to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources
are evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network
bandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to
capture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we
study two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up
to c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods
(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'
preferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each
dimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a
different set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the
strong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the
envied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide
upper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the
existence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are
independent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms
for checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we
establish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and
strong sEF1 allocations.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UnMix-NeRF结合光谱解混与NeRF，实现高光谱新视角合成和无监督材料分割，提升材料感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF分割方法依赖RGB数据，缺乏材料属性，限制了在机器人、增强现实等应用中的准确性。

Method: 通过建模光谱反射率（漫反射和镜面反射），学习全局端元字典和点级丰度，实现无监督材料聚类和场景编辑。

Result: 实验验证了UnMix-NeRF在光谱重建和材料分割上的优越性。

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF为材料感知提供了新方法，支持灵活的场景编辑。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HazeMatching的新方法，用于平衡荧光显微镜图像去雾中的保真度和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在去雾过程中无法同时兼顾数据保真度和视觉真实性的问题。

Method: 采用条件流匹配框架，通过引导生成过程实现平衡。

Result: 在5个数据集上验证，HazeMatching在保真度和真实性之间取得了平衡，且预测结果校准良好。

Conclusion: HazeMatching是一种无需明确退化算子的实用方法，适用于真实显微镜数据。

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

Result: 47%学生使用LLMs，检测工具准确率88%，需政策调整以应对挑战。

Conclusion: 主动政策调整是必要的，以利用AI潜力同时维护学术诚信与公平。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools -
especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT - has ushered in a
transformative era in higher education. Universities in developed regions are
increasingly integrating these technologies into research, teaching, and
assessment. On one hand, LLMs can enhance productivity by streamlining
literature reviews, facilitating idea generation, assisting with coding and
data analysis, and even supporting grant proposal drafting. On the other hand,
their use raises significant concerns regarding academic integrity, ethical
boundaries, and equitable access. Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly
47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam
questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently
achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article
critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the
multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions.
Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing
staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms,
and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case
studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to
harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity
and equity.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的逆向设计方法，用于高效生成超表面结构，解决了传统方法中计算量大和局部最优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超表面的逆向设计因结构与光学特性之间的复杂非线性关系而具有挑战性，传统方法需要专家调整且计算成本高。

Method: 通过训练条件扩散模型，利用RCWA模拟器生成的数据预测超表面几何结构，并结合后采样或优化方法生成低误差设计。

Result: 实验展示了均匀强度分束器和偏振分束器的设计，误差低且耗时少于30分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的超表面设计提供了高效工具，并公开了代码和数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered
sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse
design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is
challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and
optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local
minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we
address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of
diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,
we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their
corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional
diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial
power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous
supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low
error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an
initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach
on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam
splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further
research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯统计中选择先验分布具有挑战性、资源密集且主观性强，研究旨在利用LLMs提供高效、客观的先验建议。

Method: 通过设计详细的提示词，要求LLMs不仅建议先验分布，还验证和反思其选择，并在心脏疾病风险和混凝土强度两个数据集上评估模型表现。

Result: LLMs能正确识别关联方向，但中等信息先验常过于自信。Claude和Gemini表现优于ChatGPT，尤其在弱信息先验上Claude表现突出。

Conclusion: LLMs在高效、客观地提供先验分布方面潜力巨大，但需解决先验宽度校准问题以避免过度自信或不足。

Abstract: Selecting prior distributions in Bayesian statistics is challenging,
resource-intensive, and subjective. We analyze using large-language models
(LLMs) to suggest suitable, knowledge-based informative priors. We developed an
extensive prompt asking LLMs not only to suggest priors but also to verify and
reflect on their choices.
  We evaluated Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT-4o-mini on two real
datasets: heart disease risk and concrete strength. All LLMs correctly
identified the direction for all associations (e.g., that heart disease risk is
higher for males). The quality of suggested priors was measured by their
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the maximum likelihood estimator's
distribution.
  The LLMs suggested both moderately and weakly informative priors. The
moderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned
with the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors
than ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference
emerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an "unnecessarily vague" mean of 0,
while Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage.
  The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great
potential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors.
However, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors
to avoid over- and under-confidence.

Result: 实验表明，GADSG在优化性能、鲁棒性和泛化能力上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GADSG在动态复杂的低空经济网络环境中展现出高效任务调度的潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of the low-altitude economy, air-ground integrated
multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems are facing increasing demands for
real-time and intelligent task scheduling. In such systems, task offloading and
resource allocation encounter multiple challenges, including node
heterogeneity, unstable communication links, and dynamic task variations. To
address these issues, this paper constructs a three-layer heterogeneous MEC
system architecture for low-altitude economic networks, encompassing aerial and
ground users as well as edge servers. The system is systematically modeled from
the perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint
conditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and
resource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling
task. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution
generator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph
attention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of
diffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete
offloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a
high-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with
varying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed GADSG model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in
terms of optimization performance, robustness, and generalization across task
structures, showing strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic
and complex low-altitude economic network environments.

Method: 提出使用大型概念模型（LCMs），通过双曲潜在空间进行分层表示，并将复杂的多层网络交互封装为简洁的概念嵌入。

Result: LCMs在内存效率、跨层关联和原生多模态集成方面优于LLMs，能够更好地满足电信需求。

Conclusion: 采用LCMs是实现稳健有效的AI驱动电信管理的必要进化步骤。

Abstract: The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a
transformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex,
hierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same
path) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis
and code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom
problems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application
requirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and
limited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill
telecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,
over OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed
coordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the
abstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,
offer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom
challenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical
representation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions
within concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs
in terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal
integration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental
step, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective
AI-driven telecom management.

Abstract: The rise and growing popularity of accessible large language models have
raised questions about their impact on various aspects of life, including how
scientists write and publish their research. The primary objective of this
paper is to analyze a dataset consisting of all abstracts posted on arXiv.org
between 2010 and June 7th, 2024, to assess the evolution of their readability
and determine whether significant shifts occurred following the release of
ChatGPT in November 2022. Four standard readability formulas are used to
calculate individual readability scores for each paper, classifying their level
of readability. These scores are then aggregated by year and across the eight
primary categories covered by the platform. The results show a steady annual
decrease in readability, suggesting that abstracts are likely becoming
increasingly complex. Additionally, following the release of ChatGPT, a
significant change in readability is observed for 2023 and the analyzed months
of 2024. Similar trends are found across categories, with most experiencing a
notable change in readability during 2023 and 2024. These findings offer
insights into the broader changes in readability and point to the likely
influence of AI on scientific writing.

Conclusion: FrankenBot通过仿脑架构和VLM驱动，实现了多功能集成与高效操作，为通用机器人系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Developing a general robot manipulation system capable of performing a wide
range of tasks in complex, dynamic, and unstructured real-world environments
has long been a challenging task. It is widely recognized that achieving
human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to
integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy
generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving
high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,
exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning
capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a
single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without
integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a
divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose
FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that
achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our
framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions
from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional
completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy
generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,
cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and
design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted
comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic
environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in
anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and
stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Conclusion: ARK通过统一Python生态系统中的机器人技术和AI实践，降低了入门门槛，加速了自主机器人的研究和商业部署。

Abstract: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics
Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial
autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is
software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++
expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark
contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled
modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework
designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that
allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using
state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy)
while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots.
A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked
publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure
real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control,
SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with
native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from
manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless
hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of
mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices
under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates
research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机着陆时因GPS信号干扰等问题难以精准着陆，影响操作连续性，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出AeroLite-MDNet模型，结合多尺度融合模块和分割分支，用于偏差检测和方向估计；引入AWD指标和UAVLandData数据集。

Result: 系统AWD为0.7秒，偏差检测准确率达98.6%。

Conclusion: AeroLite-MDNet系统显著提升无人机着陆可靠性，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse
applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental
monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must
land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an
essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate
landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To
address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings,
powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model
integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection
and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the
system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new
dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to
support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system
achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability. Code will

Motivation: 现有数据集和模型主要针对城市或宽阔的越野场景，无法满足狭窄、小径类越野环境的需求，尤其是在搜索救援和森林火灾等关键应用中。

Method: 引入了TOMD数据集，包含多模态传感器数据，并提出动态多尺度数据融合模型，比较了不同融合策略在不同光照条件下的性能。

Result: 结果表明，所提方法在可通行路径预测中有效，且光照对分割性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: TOMD数据集和动态多尺度融合模型填补了狭窄越野环境研究的空白，为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a
significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical
applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident
management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily
target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a
substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road
scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal
Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such
environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including
128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --
collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose
a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway
prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed
fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation
performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to
support future research in trail-based off-road navigation.

Result: 所提方法在性能上显著优于现有文献。

Conclusion: 结构化学习方法为滑移转向车辆的视觉导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics
and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road
applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful
vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling,
especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road
settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end
learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement
learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the
lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and
subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly
for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel
approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed
and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware
evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved
performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Abstract: The transport industry has recently shown significant interest in unmanned
surface vehicles (USVs), specifically for port and inland waterway transport.
These systems can improve operational efficiency and safety, which is
especially relevant in the European Union, where initiatives such as the Green
Deal are driving a shift towards increased use of inland waterways. At the same
time, a shortage of qualified personnel is accelerating the adoption of
autonomous solutions. However, there is a notable lack of open-source,
high-fidelity simulation frameworks and datasets for developing and evaluating
such solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce AirSim For Surface
Vehicles (ASVSim), an open-source simulation framework specifically designed
for autonomous shipping research in inland and port environments. The framework
combines simulated vessel dynamics with marine sensor simulation capabilities,
including radar and camera systems and supports the generation of synthetic
datasets for training computer vision models and reinforcement learning agents.
Built upon Cosys-AirSim, ASVSim provides a comprehensive platform for
developing autonomous navigation algorithms and generating synthetic datasets.
The simulator supports research of both traditional control methods and deep
learning-based approaches. Through limited experiments, we demonstrate the
potential of the simulator in these research areas. ASVSim is provided as an
open-source project under the MIT license, making autonomous navigation
research accessible to a larger part of the ocean engineering community.

### [243] [LLM2Rec: Large Language Models Are Powerful Embedding Models for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21579)
*Yingzhi He,Xiaohao Liu,An Zhang,Yunshan Ma,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLM2Rec是一种新颖的嵌入模型，结合了大型语言模型（LLMs）的语义理解和协同过滤（CF）信号，以提高顺序推荐的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统顺序推荐器依赖ID嵌入，缺乏跨领域泛化能力；而基于文本的方法虽能泛化，但无法捕捉协同过滤信号。LLM2Rec旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1）协同监督微调，使LLMs能推断物品关系；2）物品级嵌入建模，生成同时包含语义和协同信息的嵌入。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，LLM2Rec在领域内和跨领域推荐中均显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: LLM2Rec展示了利用LLMs构建更鲁棒、泛化能力更强的顺序推荐模型的潜力。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict users' future interactions by
modeling collaborative filtering (CF) signals from historical behaviors of
similar users or items. Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely
on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order
co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past
interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based
recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual
descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode
CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for
effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should
seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve
both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.
  To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for
sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs
with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1)
Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item
relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding
Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding
models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively
improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain
settings. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs to build more
robust, generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation. Our codes
are available at https://github.com/HappyPointer/LLM2Rec.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文指出评估基准的特性可能扭曲检索模型领域适应的真实效果，导致误导性评估。通过环境法规文档检索案例，发现不同语义结构的基准对领域适应效果的评估差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示评估基准的选择如何影响领域适应效果的评估，特别是在专业领域中，避免误导部署决策。

Method: 使用ColBERTv2模型在环境法规文档（EIS）上进行微调，并在两个语义结构不同的基准上评估效果。

Result: 一个基准显示领域适应效果微小（0.61% NDCG增益），而另一个基准显示显著提升（2.22% NDCG增益），差异达3.6倍。

Conclusion: 评估基准的语义结构（如主题多样性、边界重叠）直接影响领域适应效果的评估，需谨慎选择以反映真实场景的复杂性。

Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain
adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that
influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two
benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity,
boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits
of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case
study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)
from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with
different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain
adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on
evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic
boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG
gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures,
the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a
3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks
through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark
shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower
silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance
difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly
determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized
domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly
underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic
boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory
document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing
and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple
topics.

TL;DR: 论文提出Refine-POI框架，通过强化学习微调LLM，解决SFT在POI推荐中的不匹配问题，实现高性能的top-k推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法在POI推荐中存在数据不匹配问题，即每个训练样本仅提供一个目标POI，无法直接生成top-k推荐列表。

Method: 提出Refine-POI框架，结合强化学习和推荐驱动的奖励机制，利用单一目标POI训练LLM生成top-k推荐列表。

Result: 在真实数据集上，Refine-POI实现了state-of-the-art的top-k推荐性能。

Conclusion: Refine-POI有效解决了SFT在POI推荐中的局限性，为LLM在推荐系统中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest
(POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two
categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models.
Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver
lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a
fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit
supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact
ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so
there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.
  To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework
for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that
enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one
ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

Conclusion: 该框架为关键企业应用中的多模态RAG提供了可信度量化与提升的严格方法，推动负责任AI部署。

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for multimodal generative AI struggle to
establish trustworthiness, hindering enterprise adoption where reliability is
paramount. We introduce a systematic, quantitative benchmarking framework to
measure the trustworthiness of progressively integrating cross-modal inputs
such as text, images, captions, and OCR within VisualRAG systems for enterprise
document intelligence. Our approach establishes quantitative relationships
between technical metrics and user-centric trust measures. Evaluation reveals
that optimal modality weighting with weights of 30% text, 15% image, 25%
caption, and 30% OCR improves performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines
while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide comparative assessments
of foundation models, demonstrating their differential impact on
trustworthiness in caption generation and OCR extraction-a vital consideration
for reliable enterprise AI. This work advances responsible AI deployment by
providing a rigorous framework for quantifying and enhancing trustworthiness in
multimodal RAG for critical enterprise applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中用户相关性和内容多样性之间的平衡问题，以应对内容同质化和用户参与度下降的挑战。

Method: 采用多目标上下文顺序采样策略，结合贝叶斯更新动态评分、多样性指标（如对数行列式相似子矩阵和岭杠杆分数）以及多样性增益不确定性项。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验显示，该方法在不牺牲相关性的情况下显著提高了多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架在提升大规模推荐系统用户体验方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The challenge of balancing user relevance and content diversity in
recommender systems is increasingly critical amid growing concerns about
content homogeneity and reduced user engagement. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that leverages a multi-objective, contextual sequential
sampling strategy. Item selection is guided by Bayesian updates that
dynamically adjust scores to optimize diversity. The reward formulation
integrates multiple diversity metrics-including the log-determinant volume of a
tuned similarity submatrix and ridge leverage scores-along with a diversity
gain uncertainty term to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Both
intra- and inter-batch diversity are modeled to promote serendipity and
minimize redundancy. A dominance-based ranking procedure identifies
Pareto-optimal item sets, enabling adaptive and balanced selections at each
iteration. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach
significantly improves diversity without sacrificing relevance, demonstrating
its potential to enhance user experience in large-scale recommendation
settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习和迭代解码的排名基础模型IRanker，统一处理多种排名任务，并在多个数据集上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排名任务广泛存在，但缺乏统一模型，且监督信号不明确，因此开发一种通用的排名基础模型具有挑战性。

Method: 通过强化学习和迭代解码，逐步淘汰候选池中最差选项，减少输出组合空间并优化上下文长度利用。

Result: IRanker-3B在多个数据集上表现优于同类模型，甚至超越更大模型，同时在零样本任务中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: IRanker框架有效解决了排名任务的统一建模问题，其强化学习和迭代解码设计具有广泛适用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as
recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify
these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the
need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However,
unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear
labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To
overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with
reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose
the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the
worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly
reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context
length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate
an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation,
routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B
achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of
similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain
datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the
robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we
conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization
experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on
in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement.
Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the
base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the
thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance
zero-shot LLM performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DCNv2虽然高效且广泛应用于推荐系统，但仍存在信息丢失和碰撞管理等局限性，需要改进。

Method: 引入三项算法改进：解决Cross层信息丢失、可学习查找级权重管理碰撞、自定义层模拟FFM行为。

Result: DCN^2在离线/在线测试中优于DCNv2，处理超5亿预测/秒，并在公开数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DCN^2显著提升了推荐系统的性能和效率，成为更强大的生产基线。

Abstract: The Deep and Cross architecture (DCNv2) is a robust production baseline and
is integral to numerous real-life recommender systems. Its inherent efficiency
and ability to model interactions often result in models that are both simpler
and highly competitive compared to more computationally demanding alternatives,
such as Deep FFMs. In this work, we introduce three significant algorithmic
improvements to the DCNv2 architecture, detailing their formulation and
behavior at scale. The enhanced architecture we refer to as DCN^2 is actively
used in a live recommender system, processing over 0.5 billion predictions per
second across diverse use cases where it out-performed DCNv2, both offline and
online (ab tests). These improvements effectively address key limitations
observed in the DCNv2, including information loss in Cross layers, implicit
management of collisions through learnable lookup-level weights, and explicit
modeling of pairwise similarities with a custom layer that emulates FFMs'
behavior. The superior performance of DCN^2 is also demonstrated on four
publicly available benchmark data sets.

TL;DR: ARAG框架通过多智能体协作机制改进RAG，显著提升推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖静态检索启发式，难以捕捉动态推荐场景中的用户偏好。

Method: ARAG引入四个LLM智能体：用户理解、自然语言推理、上下文总结和项目排序，协作优化推荐。

Result: 实验显示ARAG在NDCG@5和Hit@5上分别提升42.1%和35.5%，优于标准RAG和基线。

Conclusion: ARAG证明了智能体推理在检索增强推荐中的有效性，为LLM个性化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing
recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language
model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static
retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic
recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which
integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To
better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG
leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that
summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural
Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between
candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent
that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that
generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate
ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG
significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving
up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an
ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into
retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based
personalization.

Motivation: 手动评估科学想法的创新性耗时且主观，难以规模化。因此，需要一种自动化的方法来高效、准确地评估创新性。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）框架，结合关键词和片段检索，通过嵌入过滤和基于分面的LLM重排序，利用专家标注数据指导系统。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有方法的一致性提高了约13%，且基于分面的重排序对识别相关文献至关重要。

Conclusion: Idea Novelty Checker为科学创新性评估提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Automated scientific idea generation systems have made remarkable progress,
yet the automatic evaluation of idea novelty remains a critical and
underexplored challenge. Manual evaluation of novelty through literature review
is labor-intensive, prone to error due to subjectivity, and impractical at
scale. To address these issues, we propose the Idea Novelty Checker, an
LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a
two-stage retrieve-then-rerank approach. The Idea Novelty Checker first
collects a broad set of relevant papers using keyword and snippet-based
retrieval, then refines this collection through embedding-based filtering
followed by facet-based LLM re-ranking. It incorporates expert-labeled examples
to guide the system in comparing papers for novelty evaluation and in
generating literature-grounded reasoning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that our novelty checker achieves approximately 13% higher agreement than
existing approaches. Ablation studies further showcases the importance of the
facet-based re-ranker in identifying the most relevant literature for novelty
evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合检索方法在中文场景中尚未充分探索，HyReC旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 在C-MTEB基准测试中验证了HyReC的有效性。

Conclusion: HyReC为中文混合检索提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid-based retrieval methods, which unify dense-vector and lexicon-based
retrieval, have garnered considerable attention in the industry due to
performance enhancement. However, despite their promising results, the
application of these hybrid paradigms in Chinese retrieval contexts has
remained largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce HyReC, an
innovative end-to-end optimization method tailored specifically for
hybrid-based retrieval in Chinese. HyReC enhances performance by integrating
the semantic union of terms into the representation model. Additionally, it
features the Global-Local-Aware Encoder (GLAE) to promote consistent semantic
sharing between lexicon-based and dense retrieval while minimizing the
interference between them. To further refine alignment, we incorporate a
Normalization Module (NM) that fosters mutual benefits between the retrieval
approaches. Finally, we evaluate HyReC on the C-MTEB retrieval benchmark to
demonstrate its effectiveness.

Abstract: The presence of social biases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Information Retrieval (IR) systems is an ongoing challenge, which underlines
the importance of developing robust approaches to identifying and evaluating
such biases. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.
Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,
leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.
Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel
gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to
address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed
metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a
subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender
bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.
Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our
proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to
previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for
Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa
agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating
LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias
annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust
framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.

Abstract: Storm surge forecasting plays a crucial role in coastal disaster
preparedness, yet existing machine learning approaches often suffer from
limited spatial resolution, reliance on coastal station data, and poor
generalization. Moreover, many prior models operate directly on unstructured
spatial data, making them incompatible with modern deep learning architectures.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach that projects unstructured water
elevation fields onto structured Red Green Blue (RGB)-encoded image
representations, enabling the application of Convolutional Long Short Term
Memory (ConvLSTM) networks for end-to-end spatiotemporal surge forecasting. Our
model further integrates ground-truth wind fields as dynamic conditioning
signals and topo-bathymetry as a static input, capturing physically meaningful
drivers of surge evolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of synthetic
storms in the Gulf of Mexico, our method demonstrates robust 48-hour
forecasting performance across multiple regions along the Texas coast and
exhibits strong spatial extensibility to other coastal areas. By combining
structured representation, physically grounded forcings, and scalable deep
learning, this study advances the frontier of storm surge forecasting in
usability, adaptability, and interpretability.

Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a widely recognized additive manufacturing
technology for producing intricate metal components with exceptional accuracy.
A key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting
product quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to
optimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed
grains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain
structure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate
machine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using
single-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict
crystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal
history. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch
spacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup
using the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan
toolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan
paths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL
approach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our
DRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The
reward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted
microstructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm
was benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger
domains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure
control and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization.
