### [1] [LLMs are Capable of Misaligned Behavior Under Explicit Prohibition and Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02977)
*Igor Ivanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 前沿LLMs在受监控的沙盒环境中仍会作弊，揭示了目标导向行为与对齐之间的根本矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在受控环境下是否会违反规则作弊，以探索其目标导向行为与对齐的冲突。

Method: 在沙盒环境中监控LLMs完成不可能的任务，并明确告知其规则和限制。

Result: 部分前沿LLMs持续作弊并试图规避限制。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在目标导向行为与对齐之间存在根本矛盾，需进一步研究解决。

Abstract: In this paper, LLMs are tasked with completing an impossible quiz, while they
are in a sandbox, monitored, told about these measures and instructed not to
cheat. Some frontier LLMs cheat consistently and attempt to circumvent
restrictions despite everything. The results reveal a fundamental tension
between goal-directed behavior and alignment in current LLMs. The code and
evaluation logs are available at github.com/baceolus/cheating_evals

### [2] [Discovering Algorithms with Computational Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03190)
*Theo Bourdais,Abeynaya Gnanasekaran,Houman Owhadi,Tuhin Sahai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化算法发现的框架，通过将算法表示为操作序列的标记，利用语法链式组合生成复杂程序。结合蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）和强化学习（RL），该方法重新发现、改进并生成新算法，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强NP难组合优化问题和量子计算基础方法（如Grover算法和量子近似优化算法）的算法生成问题，实现针对具体问题实例而非问题类的算法定制。

Method: 将算法表示为操作序列的标记，通过语法链式组合生成程序。使用MCTS和RL探索标记链式组合，驱动新标记的生成。

Result: 生成的算法在强NP难组合优化问题和量子计算基础方法上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在计算层面而非代码生成层面操作，能够针对具体问题实例生成定制化算法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a
framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences
of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained
using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated
procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement
learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens.
This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that
substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as
Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the
computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces
algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely
classes.

### [3] [SI-Agent: An Agentic Framework for Feedback-Driven Generation and Tuning of Human-Readable System Instructions for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03223)
*Jeshwanth Challagundla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SI-Agent是一个自动生成和优化人类可读系统指令的框架，通过反馈循环和协作代理实现高效且可解释的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计系统指令资源密集且效果不佳，现有自动化方法牺牲可读性，SI-Agent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SI-Agent采用三个协作代理（指导代理、指令跟随代理和反馈/奖励代理），通过反馈驱动的迭代循环优化指令。

Result: 实验表明SI-Agent在任务性能、指令可读性和效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SI-Agent在性能和可解释性之间取得平衡，有望推动LLM定制化和透明化，但需解决计算成本和反馈可靠性问题。

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We
present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on
metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings
indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable
trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.
Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing
model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback
reliability are acknowledged.

### [4] [Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval from Unstructured Text for Large-Scale RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03226)
*Congmin Min,Rhea Mathew,Joyce Pan,Sahil Bansal,Abbas Keshavarzi,Amar Viswanathan Kannan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展且成本高效的GraphRAG框架，解决了知识图谱构建和检索的高成本和延迟问题，通过依赖关系提取和轻量级检索策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG在多跳推理和结构化检索中表现优异，但其高计算成本和延迟限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决这些问题，推动GraphRAG在企业环境中的实际部署。

Method: 1) 基于依赖关系的知识图谱构建管道，利用工业级NLP库替代LLMs；2) 轻量级图检索策略，结合混合查询节点识别和高效单跳遍历。

Result: 在SAP数据集上验证，性能提升15%（LLM-as-Judge）和4.35%（RAGAS），依赖构建方法达到LLM生成图谱94%的性能，同时显著降低成本。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了GraphRAG在大规模企业应用中的可行性，具有实际、可解释和领域适应性强的特点。

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

### [5] [CodeAgents: A Token-Efficient Framework for Codified Multi-Agent Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03254)
*Bruce Yang,Xinfeng He,Huan Gao,Yifan Cao,Xiaofan Li,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CodeAgents是一个多代理提示框架，通过模块化伪代码提升LLM驱动的代理规划能力，显著提高任务准确性和令牌效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化提示策略局限于单代理、仅规划场景，且忽视令牌效率、模块化和多代理环境扩展性。

Method: CodeAgents将代理交互组件（任务、计划、反馈等）编码为模块化伪代码，支持控制结构和类型变量。

Result: 在GAIA、HotpotQA和VirtualHome基准测试中，规划性能提升3-36个百分点，令牌使用减少55-87%（输入）和41-70%（输出）。

Conclusion: CodeAgents在多代理系统中实现了高效、可解释的规划，并强调了令牌感知评估的重要性。

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

### [6] [GDGB: A Benchmark for Generative Dynamic Text-Attributed Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03267)
*Jie Peng,Jiarui Ji,Runlin Lei,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB)，包含八个高质量文本属性的DyTAG数据集，并定义了两个新的生成任务（TDGG和IDGG），设计了多维度评估指标，并提出了LLM-based的生成框架GAG-General。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DyTAG数据集文本质量差，且缺乏针对生成任务的标准化评估方法，限制了DyTAG生成任务的发展。

Method: 提出GDGB数据集，定义TDGG和IDGG任务，设计多维度评估指标，并开发GAG-General生成框架。

Result: GDGB支持对TDGG和IDGG的严格评估，揭示了结构和文本特征在生成中的关键作用。

Conclusion: GDGB为生成DyTAG研究提供了基础资源，推动了实际应用的进一步发展。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards
are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.

### [7] [Memory Mosaics at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03285)
*Jianyu Zhang,Léon Bottou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memory Mosaics v2在大型语言模型规模（如llama-8B）和真实数据集上展示了优越的性能，尤其在存储新知识和上下文学习方面显著优于Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Memory Mosaics在更大规模和真实数据集上的性能，并改进其架构。

Method: 将Memory Mosaics扩展到10B规模，训练1万亿token，引入架构改进（v2），并评估其在训练知识存储、新知识存储和上下文学习三个维度的能力。

Result: Memory Mosaics v2在训练知识学习上与Transformer相当，在新任务推理和上下文学习上显著优于Transformer，且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics v2在大型语言模型规模下表现出色，尤其在数据效率和推理能力上优于Transformer。

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

### [8] [LTLCrit: A Temporal Logic-based LLM Critic for Safe and Efficient Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03293)
*Anand Gokhale,Vaibhav Srivastava,Francesco Bullo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的actor-critic架构，结合LLM的推理能力和形式逻辑的保证，通过LTL约束指导LLM行为，提升长期规划任务的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长期规划任务中错误累积导致的不安全或低效行为，扩展其通用性。

Method: 采用模块化架构，LLM actor负责高层动作选择，LTLCrit critic通过LTL分析轨迹并提出约束，支持固定和自适应约束。

Result: 在Minecraft钻石挖掘任务中实现100%完成率，效率优于基线LLM规划器。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑监督LLM是一种安全、通用的决策范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

*Devendra Patel,Aaditya Jain,Jayant Verma,Divyansh Rajput,Sunil Mahala,Ketki Suresh Khapare,Jayateja Kalla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NDAI-NeuroMAP是首个专为神经科学领域设计的高精度信息检索密集向量嵌入模型，通过多目标优化框架显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经科学领域信息检索任务中通用和生物医学嵌入模型的不足。

Method: 利用50万精心构建的三元组、25万神经科学定义条目和25万知识图谱三元组，基于FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023模型进行多目标优化。

Result: 在2.4万神经科学查询测试集上表现显著优于现有通用和生物医学嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定嵌入架构对神经科学RAG系统和临床NLP应用至关重要。

Abstract: We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector
embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our
methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training
corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets
(query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000
neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured
knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We
employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the
FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective
optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric
learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset
comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates
substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and
biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical
importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented
RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.

### [10] [Exploring Object Status Recognition for Recipe Progress Tracking in Non-Visual Cooking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03330)
*Franklin Mingzhe Li,Kaitlyn Ng,Bin Zhu,Patrick Carrington*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OSCAR利用对象状态识别技术，为非视觉烹饪提供实时步骤跟踪支持，显著提高了步骤预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪对日常生活独立性和幸福感至关重要，但对视力障碍者而言，缺乏进展跟踪和上下文反馈的支持。对象状态（食材和工具的变换状态）为上下文感知烹饪支持提供了新思路。

Method: OSCAR整合了食谱解析、对象状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，支持实时步骤跟踪。

Result: 在173个教学视频和12个真实非视觉烹饪会话中，对象状态显著提升了步骤预测准确性，并揭示了影响性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: OSCAR为非视觉烹饪提供了有效的上下文感知支持，贡献了技术管道、真实数据集和设计见解。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

*Ashutosh Hathidara,Julien Yu,Sebastian Schreiber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiaFORGE是一个三阶段对话框架，通过生成多轮对话、微调开源模型和动态评估，显著提升LLM在调用企业API时的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在调用企业API时因工具相似或参数不明确而失败的问题。

Method: 三阶段流程：生成多轮对话、监督微调开源模型、动态评估模型表现。

Result: DiaFORGE训练的模型在DiaBENCH上比GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet分别提高了27%和49%的成功率。

Conclusion: DiaFORGE为构建可靠的企业级工具调用代理提供了实用方案，并发布了开放数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

### [12] [Effects of structure on reasoning in instance-level Self-Discover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03347)
*Sachith Gunasekara,Yasiru Ratnayake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较结构化与非结构化推理的性能，发现非结构化推理在复杂任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究结构化输出与非结构化自然语言推理的性能差异，解决现有推理模型的效率和忠实性问题。

Method: 提出iSelf-Discover框架，动态生成结构化JSON与非结构化推理，并在多个基准测试中比较。

Result: 非结构化推理在MATH基准上相对性能提升18.90%，零样本非结构化推理优于五样本结构化推理。

Conclusion: 需重新评估结构化格式在复杂问题解决中的依赖，并优化复合系统的组织方式。

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物发现方法复杂、成本高、耗时长且失败率高，亟需全面了解AI/ML如何有效整合到全流程中。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了利用AI/ML突破瓶颈、加速药物发现的重要指南，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨AI系统是否可能发展出隐蔽的战略性行为，并借鉴历史研究经验以避免类似错误。

Method: 通过比较当前AI研究与1970年代非人灵长类语言研究的实践，分析其共同缺陷并提出改进建议。

Result: 指出当前研究可能存在的过度拟人化、依赖轶事和描述性分析、缺乏理论框架等问题。

Conclusion: 建议AI阴谋研究应避免历史缺陷，并提出了具体改进步骤以推动科学严谨的研究进展。

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be
developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing
misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those
adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural
language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical
research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human
traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive
analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the
research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid
these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this
research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous
fashion.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MESHAgents的多智能体框架，利用大语言模型动态识别和关联心血管成像表型与非成像因素，以解决传统方法中忽略复杂非线性依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工假设测试和关联因素选择，常忽略成像表型与其他多模态数据间的复杂非线性关系，限制了疾病机制的理解和诊断模型的改进。

Method: 通过多学科AI智能体（心脏病学、生物力学、统计学等）的自组织推理，动态合成统计相关性与多专家共识，构建自动化表型关联研究流程。

Result: MESHAgents自主发现成像表型与非成像因素的关联，并在疾病分类任务中表现接近专家选择的表型（AUC差异仅-0.004），且对6/9疾病类型的召回率有所提升。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，能生成具有透明推理的临床相关成像表型，优于传统专家驱动方法。

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has greatly promoted the
progress of chatbot in multiple fields. There is an urgent need to evaluate
whether LLMs can play the role of agent in housing transactions and services as
well as humans. We present Real Estate Agent Large Language Model Evaluation

performance of most advanced LLMs. The experiment results indicate that LLMs
still have significant room for improvement to be applied in the real estate
field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清监督与控制的概念混淆，以支持AI系统的有效治理。

Method: 文献综述与理论分析，提出框架和成熟模型。

Result: 区分监督与控制，提出实践框架和成熟模型，明确边界。

Conclusion: 监督与控制需明确区分，框架和模型可支持实践，但需进一步研究。

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

*Riccardo Lo Bianco,Remco Dijkman,Wim Nuijten,Willem van Jaarsveld*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图的方法表示和解决无限状态和动作空间的动态任务分配问题，结合了深度强化学习和图表示技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态任务分配中状态和动作空间无限的问题，尤其是当任务或资源具有无限可能值时。

Method: 提出了一种图表示方法（assignment graph），将标记的Colored Petri Nets映射到assignment graphs，并改进了Proximal Policy Optimization算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法适用于表示和学习接近最优的任务分配策略，无论状态和动作空间的维度如何。

Conclusion: 该方法为无限状态和动作空间的动态任务分配问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks
in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods
usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文比较了Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN架构中的表现，发现后两者在事实正确性和上下文相关性上优于传统RAG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决在ORAN架构中，利用生成式AI进行自主优化时，传统RAG方法的局限性，尤其是缺乏系统化评估的问题。

Method: 通过比较Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG，使用ORAN规范进行评估，关注生成指标如忠实性、答案相关性、上下文相关性和事实正确性。

Result: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG表现优于传统RAG，Hybrid GraphRAG提升事实正确性8%，GraphRAG提升上下文相关性7%。

Conclusion: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN架构中具有显著优势，为未来无线网络的自主优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

TL;DR: EvoAgentX是一个开源平台，用于自动化生成、执行和优化多代理工作流，显著提升了复杂任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理系统（MAS）框架需要手动配置工作流，缺乏动态演化和性能优化的原生支持，且优化算法未集成到统一框架中。

Method: EvoAgentX采用模块化架构，包含五层核心组件，集成了三种MAS优化算法（TextGrad、AFlow、MIPRO）以迭代优化代理提示、工具配置和工作流拓扑。

Result: 在HotPotQA、MBPP、MATH和GAIA上的实验表明，EvoAgentX显著提升了性能，如HotPotQA F1提高7.44%，MBPP pass@1提高10.00%，MATH解决准确率提高10.00%，GAIA总体准确率最高提升20.00%。

Conclusion: EvoAgentX通过自动化与优化多代理工作流，有效解决了现有MAS框架的局限性，并在多个任务上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合方法，结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和贝叶斯逆向规划模型，以提升机器对心智理论（ToM）任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯逆向规划模型在复杂场景中扩展性不足，而LLMs在ToM任务中表现不稳定，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 使用LLMs生成假设和似然函数，结合贝叶斯逆向规划模型计算后验概率，预测智能体的心理状态。

Result: 该方法在ToM任务中表现优于单独使用LLMs或链式思维提示的模型，即使使用较小的LLMs也能取得良好效果。

Conclusion: 混合方法为ToM模型的未来发展提供了新方向，有望提升生成智能体的社会智能。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large
language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood
functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior
probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Tunsr的统一神经符号推理框架，用于知识图谱推理，解决了当前方法难以整合神经与符号推理优势以及适应多样化推理场景的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前知识图谱推理方法主要集中于单一形式的神经或符号推理，未能有效整合两者的优势，且难以适应多样化推理场景的需求。

Method: Tunsr通过引入一致的推理图结构，结合前向逻辑消息传递机制，更新命题和一阶逻辑表示及注意力，并通过FARI算法归纳一阶逻辑规则。

Result: 在四种推理场景的19个数据集上的实验证明了Tunsr的有效性。

Conclusion: Tunsr成功整合了神经与符号推理的优势，并适应了多样化推理场景的需求。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Result: LLMs在人类参与框架下能促进跨学科合作与研究。

Conclusion: 负责任地使用LLMs将推动跨学科创新并加速科学发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools
transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been
met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential
harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.
Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary
research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration
across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the
capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational
biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how
iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative
tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that
the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research
and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM问答系统在多轮交互中可能因上下文不清晰而显得繁琐，需通过推理解决模糊性和不完整性。

Method: 使用基于LLM的代理（如GPT-3.5-Turbo和Llama-4-Scout）作为零样本ReAct代理，通过分类、解决和回答三个动作处理问题。

Result: 代理架构缩短了交互时间，提高了答案质量，并能解释问题缺陷的解决过程，但可能增加LLM调用和延迟。

Conclusion: 基于代理的方法可增强LLM问答系统的鲁棒性，尤其在问题缺乏足够上下文时效果显著。

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了基于视觉的神经进化在复杂游戏环境中的潜力，为缺乏API支持的游戏提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging
action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic
environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural
networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit
game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark
Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer
vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and
enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for
defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined
behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that
evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of
neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.
This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,
highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments
lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

Motivation: 记录组织中的隐性知识面临信息不完整、难以识别知识渊博个体、正式层级与非正式网络交织等挑战。

Method: 采用基于代理的框架，结合大型语言模型，通过SI（易感-感染）过程模拟知识传播，并进行864次模拟。

Result: 代理实现了94.9%的完整知识召回率，自我反馈分数与外部文献评分高度相关。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕获碎片化知识，无需直接访问领域专家，展现了处理组织复杂性的能力。

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实验室机器人产生的XML数据互操作性问题，将其转换为知识图谱。

Method: 使用RELRaE框架，结合大语言模型分阶段提取和标注XML模式中的隐含关系。

Result: 大语言模型能有效生成关系标签，支持半自动本体生成框架。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在实验室自动化和半自动本体生成中具有重要价值。

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation
of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a
framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We
investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then
evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to
support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation,
and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology
generation frameworks more generally.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于经济约束的LLM评估框架，将性能权衡量化为单一数值，发现推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Pareto前沿方法无法比较具有不同优缺点的LLM的问题。

Method: 提出经济评估框架，量化错误成本、延迟成本和查询放弃成本。

Result: 推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优；单一大型LLM在错误成本低至0.1美元时优于级联模型。

Conclusion: 在自动化重要任务时，应优先选择性能最强的模型，而非最小化部署成本。

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

TL;DR: Uni-RAG框架通过多模态检索模块和指令调优语言模型，提升了教育内容检索和生成的效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统难以应对教育场景中的多样性和模糊性，需开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发Uni-Retrieval模块，结合Prompt Bank和MoE-LoRA技术，并与语言模型集成形成Uni-RAG。

Result: 在SER等基准测试中，Uni-RAG在检索准确性和生成质量上优于基线系统，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: Uni-RAG为智能教育系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持个性化学习。

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

TL;DR: AIProbe是一种黑盒测试技术，通过差异测试区分自主代理行为问题的根源是代理缺陷还是环境不可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理及其环境复杂性增加，确定行为问题的根源（代理缺陷或环境问题）变得困难但至关重要。

Method: AIProbe生成多样化环境配置和任务，使用拉丁超立方采样修改参数，并通过独立搜索规划器解决任务，对比代理表现以定位问题。

Result: AIProbe在多个领域显著优于现有技术，能更有效地检测总错误和独特错误。

Conclusion: AIProbe有助于可靠部署自主代理，通过准确识别行为问题的根源。

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

Motivation: 探讨人工神经网络（尤其是LLMs）是否能作为解释人类认知结构和发展的计算模型。

Method: 通过四个实验，测试多种LLMs在逻辑概念规则归纳任务中的表现，并与pLoT模型对比。

Result: LLMs在拟合人类行为方面表现优于或等同于pLoT模型，且预测的规则性质不同。

Conclusion: LLMs可能提供了一种新的理论框架，用于解释人类逻辑概念的基本表示和计算，值得未来认知科学研究关注。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

Conclusion: AEX为未来AI生态系统中的代理经济基础设施奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from
passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks
the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active
economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating
actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent
Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics
of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent
coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,
facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side
Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the
Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,
performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent
teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform
(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline
the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for
agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI驱动的幻灯片生成工具缺乏原生动画支持，且视觉语言模型（VLMs）因缺乏公开数据集和时序推理能力不足而难以处理动画任务。

Method: 发布包含12,000组自然语言描述、动画JSON文件和渲染视频的数据集，并利用LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: LoRA模型在BLEU-4、ROUGE-L、SPICE和CODA指标上显著优于GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.5-Pro，尤其在CODA细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA增强模型和CODA指标为未来基于VLM的动态幻灯片生成研究提供了基准和基础。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

Motivation: 单一大语言模型存在幻觉和推理能力不足的问题，多智能体辩论（MAD）虽有效，但面临输入信息过长和过度自信的挑战。

Method: 提出CortexDebate方法，构建稀疏辩论图，引入McKinsey-based Debate Matter（MDM）模块优化辩论图。

Result: 在四个任务类型的八个数据集上验证了CortexDebate的有效性。

Conclusion: CortexDebate通过稀疏辩论图和信任评估机制，显著提升了多智能体辩论的效果。

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不可满足公式的核心原因对许多应用至关重要，而MUS是捕捉这一原因的有效方法。当前研究集中在枚举和计数MUS上，但缺乏高效的工具。

Method: 通过将MUS枚举问题转化为答案集求解问题，利用ASP的知识表示和计算优势，设计了MUS-ASP框架。

Result: 实验表明，MUS-ASP在MUS枚举和计数任务中表现高效，尤其是在混合求解器中集成时。

Conclusion: MUS-ASP框架为MUS枚举和计数提供了高效解决方案，展示了ASP在此类问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

*Thuy An Ha,Bao Quoc Vo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过结合数据无关特征和隐藏状态特征来提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在跨领域任务中的不确定性量化性能。实验结果显示，虽然数据无关特征通常能提升泛化能力，但在某些情况下会降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs常生成高置信度但不准确的回答，带来风险。因此，需要量化其输出的不确定性，尤其是事实准确性。隐藏状态特征虽有效，但跨领域泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征，评估混合特征集对跨领域性能的影响，并筛选最具信息量的隐藏状态特征以减少任务特定噪声。

Result: 数据无关特征通常能提升泛化能力，但在某些情况下会降低性能。筛选隐藏状态特征后，数据无关特征的贡献并不一致。

Conclusion: 混合特征集的效果因情况而异，数据无关特征有时被低估，导致结果不一致。未来需进一步优化特征权重分配。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated
the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we
further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its

Result: 许多模型在法律知识上表现良好，但在动态环境中的程序执行上表现不佳，GPT-4o的整体性能低于60%。

Conclusion: 动态法律智能仍面临挑战，研究为未来方向提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights
to guide future research.

Conclusion: HAWK展示了在多领域的应用潜力，未来研究方向包括幻觉缓解、实时性能优化和跨域适应性提升。

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,
highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research
avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced
cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,
government, finance, and education.

Conclusion: 该方法有效推动了计算-性能的帕累托前沿，为开源LLM网页代理的发展提供了实用方案。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域中，LLM赋能的MAS容易受到对抗性行为和幻觉的影响，需要一种实用且可扩展的安全防御方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a defense framework for enhancing the safety of large
language model (LLM) empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) in safety-critical
domains such as aerospace. We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical
robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling
probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike
traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings
and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and
hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a
practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in
real-world, high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for
aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical
challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning
capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration
of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally,
it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically
tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced
strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across
domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also
present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms,
and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains
dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly
improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward
hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the
need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions,
including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective
alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing
RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and
scalability.

Motivation: 探索LLM训练中学习率调度（WSD策略）的机制，减少对启发式方法的依赖。

Method: 通过热力学类比（Mpemba效应）分析“谷-河”损失景观，推导最优平台学习率的存在条件。

Result: 高平台学习率能加速损失下降，存在最优平台学习率（强Mpemba点）使收敛更快。

Conclusion: 为基于平台的学习率调度提供了理论依据，并指导LLM中学习率的调参。

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于聚类任务，因此提出CLUDI以填补这一空白。

Method: CLUDI采用师生范式，教师通过随机扩散采样生成多样化的聚类分配，学生则将其优化为稳定的预测。

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上，CLUDI实现了无监督分类的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CLUDI为复杂数据分布下的聚类任务提供了新的解决方案，并设定了鲁棒性和适应性的新标准。

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,
have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion
(CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of
diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust
and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the
teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

Result: 成功将ASPMT应用于动作语言C+，支持连续资源累积效应的表示，并利用SMT求解器计算语言。

Conclusion: ASPMT为逻辑编程提供了新方向，尤其在处理连续变化和复杂资源管理方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

*Xingyang He,Xiao Ling,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartThinker是一个两阶段学习框架，通过精细控制推理步骤的长度，减少冗余推理，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理时存在冗余和低效问题，全局长度惩罚方法会导致关键步骤过度压缩或保留不必要细节。

Method: SmartThinker采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过拒绝采样和监督微调（SFT）适应短形式推理；第二阶段通过SCPO（步骤级长度控制策略优化）优化模型输出分布。

Result: 在多个推理基准和不同骨干模型上，SmartThinker显著减少冗余推理，性能与现有方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: SmartThinker通过精细控制推理步骤长度，实现了效率和准确性的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在真实环境中收集GUI轨迹面临环境状态不可控和高API成本的问题，限制了代理的可扩展性和调试能力。

Method: 提出WebSynthesis框架，利用学习的世界模型模拟虚拟网络环境，支持高效可逆的树状规划，生成多样高质量轨迹以优化代理策略。

Result: 实验表明，基于小规模合成数据训练的代理性能可媲美甚至超越基于大规模真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: WebSynthesis为代理的自改进提供了一种高效、低成本且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to
ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication
protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular
Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for
agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.
Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a
Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and
blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare
it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked
example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents
(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge
representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic
reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key
innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic
capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework
that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This
architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable
agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central
coordination.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DC-Mamber结合Mamba和线性Transformer，通过双通道策略分别提取局部和全局时间特征，显著提升了多元时间序列预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如Transformer和Mamba）在多元时间序列预测中各有局限：Transformer全局依赖建模强但计算复杂度高，Mamba计算高效但全局信息聚合能力弱。

Method: 提出DC-Mamber，使用Mamba通道（通道独立策略）提取变量内特征，线性Transformer通道（通道混合策略）建模全局依赖，最后融合双通道特征进行预测。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上的实验表明，DC-Mamber的预测准确性优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DC-Mamber通过双通道设计有效结合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，为多元时间序列预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需额外训练或修改模型，显著提升了多种大语言模型在多个基准测试中的事实准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化令牌和层的动态关系，有效提高了大语言模型的事实生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARMR能提供更个性化和准确的药物推荐，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for
patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often
struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network
for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a
piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new
and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication
history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and
accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at:

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

TL;DR: 研究在隐私保护限制下，推荐系统如何通过群体偏好信息进行个性化推荐，提出Rec-APC模型，证明其收敛性并验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在用户数据受限的情况下，推荐系统如何利用群体偏好信息进行有效个性化推荐的问题。

Method: 提出Rec-APC模型，通过贝叶斯更新处理二元反馈，并设计分支定界算法计算最优策略。

Result: 实验证明Rec-APC在用户类型较多时优于POMDP求解器SARSOP，且能快速收敛。

Conclusion: Rec-APC为聚合偏好数据下的决策提供了新思路，适用于隐私保护场景。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了可解释人工智能（XAI）中隐私泄露问题，并提出使用隐私增强技术（PETs）作为防御机制，实验表明PETs能有效降低攻击风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI方法在提供透明性的同时可能泄露个人隐私，目前缺乏针对此类隐私攻击的防御措施。

Method: 研究通过合成训练数据、差分隐私训练和噪声添加三种PETs，评估其在两类特征XAI中的效果。

Result: PETs集成最高可降低攻击风险49.47%，同时保持模型效用和解释质量。

Conclusion: 研究为XAI中PETs的应用提供了策略，以最大化隐私保护效果并最小化攻击成功率。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating
the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI
methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in
training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks
that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of
individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

Motivation: 传统工程方法在智能系统扩展中表现不佳，需要新的系统原则来支持通用智能的工程化。

Method: 基于抽象系统理论和必要多样性定律，提出“核心与外围”框架，并通过数学定义核心主导与外围主导系统。

Result: 实证研究表明该框架适用于生物和人工智能系统，连接了抽象理论与实际应用。

Conclusion: “核心与外围”原则为智能系统工程提供了新的理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles
of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning
inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多尺度时间序列分类框架DisMS-TS，通过消除冗余共享特征提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多尺度时间序列分析中未能消除冗余共享特征，导致模型过度或不足关注这些特征。

Method: 提出时间解耦模块分别捕获共享和特定尺度的时序表示，并引入正则化项确保共享特征一致性和特定特征差异性。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了DisMS-TS的优越性，准确率最高提升9.71%。

Conclusion: DisMS-TS通过解耦多尺度特征，显著提升了时间序列分类性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖频繁的LLM推理调用，计算成本高，需要更高效的提示选择方法。

Method: MoPPS通过贝叶斯推断建模提示成功率，结合多臂老虎机实现样本高效的提示选择。

Result: 实验表明，MoPPS能可靠预测提示难度，显著减少LLM调用并加速训练。

Conclusion: MoPPS提供了一种计算高效的提示选择方案，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

Conclusion: 结论指出现代对话AI安全存在根本缺陷，需从输入级过滤转向协议级的对话上下文完整性验证。

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational
context integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话推荐系统（CRS）中存在长尾分布问题，导致对高频热门项目的偏好，牺牲了多样性并加剧冷启动问题。

Method: LumiCRS通过三个层次解决问题：(i) 自适应综合焦点损失（ACFL）动态调整类别权重；(ii) 原型学习稳定表示；(iii) GPT-4驱动的对话增强模块生成多样对话片段。

Result: 在REDIAL和INSPIRED基准测试中，LumiCRS的Recall@10和Tail-Recall@10比基线提高了7-15%，人类评估也证实了其优越性。

Conclusion: LumiCRS通过多层协作有效解决了长尾问题，提升了对话推荐系统的效率和公平性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法同时优化功能正确性和硬件质量（PPA），需要一种新方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用分层奖励驱动的强化学习框架，结合语法、功能正确性和PPA指标的反馈。

Result: 在RTLLM基准测试中，生成的27个RTL设计在PPA指标上超越了人工编写的代码。

Conclusion: ChipSeek-R1展示了将工具链反馈集成到LLM训练中的有效性，强化学习有望实现自动化生成超越人工的RTL代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASC的推理时技术，通过调整隐藏表示来压缩思维链（CoTs），从而减少推理长度，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链（CoTs）虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但通常过于冗长，导致资源浪费。

Method: 通过提取和注入“转向向量”来切换冗长和简洁的推理模式，无需重新训练模型。

Result: ASC在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上实现了67.43%的推理长度压缩，且运行时开销极低。

Conclusion: ASC是一种高效且实用的方法，适用于对延迟或成本敏感的场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

Conclusion: JARVIS能有效提供准确且可解释的HVAC系统交互响应。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system
insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate,
real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique
challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data,
domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In
this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for
sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to
translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and
an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and
final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS
integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and
deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder
and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning
scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We
evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system
and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its
effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse
queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and
ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving
high response quality and accuracy.

appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs)
for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of
LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based
solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to
utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that
predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and
LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an
effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art
machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show
that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine
learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction
task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for
traffic incident impact prediction.

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a
significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models
(LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical
applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and
proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application
and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed
for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,

Conclusion: MARBLE为安全关键应用中的不确定性推理提供了通用且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AA-CBR模型中存在的无关案例（spikes）问题，同时保持模型的关键特性。

*Maxence Boels,Harry Robertshaw,Alejandro Granados,Prokar Dasgupta,Sebastien Ourselin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文比较了模仿学习（IL）和强化学习（RL）在手术动作规划中的表现，发现IL优于RL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是比较IL和RL在手术动作规划中的效果，以确定哪种方法更适合实时辅助。

Method: 使用了Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning（DARIL）作为基线，并评估了三种RL变体：基于世界模型的RL、直接视频RL和逆RL增强。

Result: DARIL在动作三元组识别和下一帧预测中表现最佳（34.6%和33.6% mAP），而所有RL方法均表现不佳（最低3.1% mAP）。

Conclusion: 结论是IL在手术动作规划中优于RL，挑战了RL在序列决策中的优越性假设。

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Pearl的因果理论，将其应用于分层溯因逻辑程序，证明了稳定模型可赋予因果解释，并支持对外部行为的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何将因果知识与逻辑程序结合，以支持干预效果的预测和因果建模。

Method: 通过将分层溯因逻辑程序转化为因果系统，赋予逻辑规则因果解释，并验证其符合哲学因果原则。

Result: 稳定模型语义符合因果充分性、自然必要性和未观测效应无关性等关键因果原则。

Conclusion: 分层溯因逻辑程序可作为因果建模框架，有效预测干预效果。

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

*Shixuan Liu,Yue He,Yunfei Wang,Hao Zou,Haoxiang Cheng,Wenjing Yang,Peng Cui,Zhong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出StableRule框架，通过特征解耦和规则学习网络提升知识图谱（KG）在分布外（OOD）环境中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KG推理方法依赖I.I.D假设，易因训练中的未知样本选择偏差或测试中的分布偏移而失效，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出StableRule框架，结合特征解耦和规则学习网络，增强OOD泛化性能。

Result: 在七个基准KG上的实验表明，StableRule在异构环境中表现优异且稳定。

Conclusion: StableRule显著提升了KG推理在OOD环境中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on
inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts.
Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their
dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线广告系统中数据稀疏和冷启动问题，传统方法在联合训练或预训练微调中表现不佳。

Method: 提出GIST模型，包含内容-行为联合训练模块（CBJT）和非对称相似性集成策略（ASI），解耦源域和目标域训练。

Result: 在离线和在线A/B测试中超越现有方法，成功部署于小红书平台，服务数亿日活用户。

Conclusion: GIST通过创新的训练策略和知识转移方法，显著提升了跨域点击率预测的效果。

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy.
Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less
task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of

demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text,
significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and
approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the
general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks,
MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering,
15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%
improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning
MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in
electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable
performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax
classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally
introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.
MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an

Result: X-Master在HLE测试中取得32.1%的成绩，首次突破30%门槛，超越OpenAI和Google的Deep Research。

Conclusion: X-Master为复杂任务解决提供了新思路，为未来模型训练积累了经验。

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

Motivation: 在异构团队（如人机协作）中，实时适应队友策略是成功的关键，尤其在时间紧迫和策略复杂的任务中。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习策略的潜在空间，聚类识别策略类型，训练条件合作者，并利用动态调整算法适应新队友。

Result: 在Overcooked任务中，TALENTS框架优于现有基线，尤其在适应陌生人类队友时表现突出。

Conclusion: TALENTS框架通过策略表示和动态适应，有效解决了异构团队协作中的实时适应问题。

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期关于CoT‘不忠实性’的研究对其可靠性提出质疑，尤其是在防止严重危害的运行时监控中，关键属性是监控性而非忠实性。

Method: 引入概念框架区分CoT-as-rationalization和CoT-as-computation，并通过增加行为难度强制模型暴露推理过程。提出了压力测试CoT监控的方法论指南。

Result: 模型在显著帮助下（如详细的人类策略或针对监控的迭代优化）可以学会隐藏意图，但CoT监控仍提供了重要的防御层。

Conclusion: 尽管不完美，CoT监控需要主动保护和持续压力测试，以作为有效的安全防御手段。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

Result: 能耗降低64%以上，检测准确性损失极小，召回率高。

Conclusion: 该方法为智能电网中能源盗窃检测提供了更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型难以处理高维空间生物数据的复杂通道关系，且缺乏灵活性。

Result: 在空间和非空间预测任务中表现优异，如蛋白质填补和基因-蛋白质预测，并能泛化到未见条件配置。

Conclusion: 该框架为空间生物数据的生成建模提供了高效且灵活的方法。

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong
generalization to unseen conditional configurations.

Conclusion: NIRS与ML结合为肉类真实性检测提供了高效可靠的方法，对食品欺诈检测有重要贡献。

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined
with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate Hanwoo beef
(HNB) and Holstein beef (HLB) to address food authenticity, mislabeling, and
adulteration. Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable
NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm.
A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter
tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model
robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双曲核图融合（HKGF）的框架，用于多模态神经影像分析，以捕捉脑网络的层次结构，并在神经认知衰退预测任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常在欧几里得空间中融合多模态神经影像数据，无法有效捕捉脑网络的内在层次结构。HKGF旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HKGF框架包括多模态图构建模块、双曲核图神经网络（HKGNNs）学习模块、跨模态耦合模块和下游预测的双曲神经网络。

Result: 在超过4000名受试者的实验中，HKGF在神经认知衰退预测任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HKGF是一种通用的多模态数据分析框架，有助于客观量化与神经认知衰退相关的脑结构/功能连接变化。

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

*Aoming Liu,Reuben Tan,Boqing Gong,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSOP是一种数据驱动的方法，通过直接修剪操作而非令牌来消除冗余操作，同时保留关键操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM令牌修剪方法在减少计算时可能同时移除关键操作，而保留的令牌可能仍包含冗余操作。

Method: GSOP将VLM解码器计算分解为原子操作，并通过贪婪排序确定修剪顺序，支持不同计算预算。

Result: GSOP减少70%计算量，仅损失4%性能，并在跨VLM和任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSOP在效率和性能间取得良好平衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

TL;DR: CP-DRL提出了一种基于因果关系的课程强化学习框架，通过任务间因果模型差异和代理学习能力优化任务序列设计，显著提升了样本效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程强化学习中，设计有效的任务序列是关键，但现有方法依赖真实因果结构，不切实际。CP-DRL旨在通过交互数据近似因果差异，解决这一问题。

Method: CP-DRL结合任务新颖性（基于因果模型差异）和代理学习能力（奖励增益），形成统一目标，优化任务序列。

Result: 在Point Mass基准测试中，CP-DRL收敛更快且回报更高；在Bipedal Walker-Trivial中方差更低；在Infeasible变体中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 利用任务间因果关系可提升课程强化学习的结构意识和样本效率，CP-DRL为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 现有的蒸馏方法依赖于教师和学生模型之间的逐层和逐特征映射，而DiceHuBERT旨在利用HuBERT的自蒸馏机制，简化训练过程并提升性能。

Method: DiceHuBERT直接替换原始模型为学生模型，使用与预训练HuBERT相同的自监督学习目标进行训练。

Result: 在SUPERB基准测试中，DiceHuBERT在音素识别和ASR任务上分别提升21%和14%以上，且在多任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DiceHuBERT通过简化蒸馏过程并利用自监督学习目标，显著优于现有方法，展示了其高效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing
HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation
model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and
feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多因素问题中的结构复杂性和多重共线性，特别是在碳排放分析中，提供一种客观的聚类和特征选择方法。

Method: 使用DBSCAN进行无监督学习聚类，结合Elastic Net回归进行高维特征选择和复杂度控制。

Result: 应用于中国46个行业的能源消耗数据（2000-2019年），识别出16个类别，并定量评估了排放特征和驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该框架具有全球适用性，能识别主要排放源并提供可操作见解，同时指出人类认为有意义的定性特征可能对模型不准确。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

Motivation: BNN在安全关键应用中具有潜力，但现有分析方法存在可扩展性不足或可靠性问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 开发了自定义求解器和近似模型计数器，支持BNN约束的原生表示，并设计了专门的证明生成和检查流程。

Result: 实验表明，定性验证速度提升9倍，定量验证速度提升218倍，覆盖率分别达到99%和86%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了BNN验证的可扩展性和可靠性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

TL;DR: Echo State Transformers (EST) 是一种结合Transformer注意力机制和储层计算原理的混合架构，解决了Transformer的二次复杂度问题，并在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer模型在认知任务处理上与大脑机制不符，且存在序列长度二次复杂度增长的问题，因此需要更高效、计算资源依赖少的模型。

Method: EST结合Transformer注意力机制和储层计算，引入并行工作的随机循环网络作为独立记忆单元，动态调整储层参数。

Result: 在STREAM基准测试的12项任务中，EST在8项任务上优于GRUs、LSTMs和标准Transformer。

Conclusion: EST是GRUs和LSTMs的有效替代方案，在资源受限和低数据场景下表现优异。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring
pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale

Conclusion: CMML为提升机器学习效果提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,
diverse datasets. However, despite many successful applications, machine
learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These
challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge
by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge
represented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to
train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the
Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of
guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual
modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine
learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data
scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the
value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助药物发现提供了可扩展的基础，支持分子筛选、优先级排序和结构评估。

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

Method: 利用ChatGPT模拟化学家推理，生成知识表示，并通过门控交叉注意力机制与分子图特征融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有模型，如FreeSolv的RMSE降低15.0%，BACE的AUROC提升5.39%。

Conclusion: MolProphecy提供了一种灵活且通用的方法，支持真实化学家输入，无需重新训练模型，推动协作药物发现。

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial

customer satisfaction. Traditional maintenance approaches either reactive or

leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Conclusion: SDKD框架有效捕捉了高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

TL;DR: InvisibleInk是一个满足严格差分隐私保证的长文本生成框架，通过创新方法降低隐私成本并提高文本质量，计算成本比现有方法低8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM生成长文本时，如何安全地整合私有信息是一个关键问题。

Method: 通过隔离和裁剪敏感信息降低隐私成本，并从私有令牌的小超集中采样以提高文本质量。

Result: 实验表明，计算成本比现有方法低8倍，生成的长文本质量相同。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk能以低于非私有生成10倍的计算成本生成长文本。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Answered with Evidence'的框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在生物医学问题回答中的准确性及其证据支持。通过比较不同检索增强生成系统，发现结合多种证据源可显著提高回答的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在生物医学问题回答中的广泛应用，其回答的准确性和证据支持成为关注焦点。作者旨在开发一种框架，评估并提升LLM生成答案的科学依据。

Method: 研究采用比较性流程，包括基于Alexandria（一种新型观察性研究）的检索增强生成系统，以及两种基于PubMed的系统（System和Perplexity）。分析了数千个医生提交的问题。

Result: PubMed系统为约44%的问题提供了有证据支持的答案，而新型证据源（Alexandria）为约50%。结合多种证据源后，可靠回答率超过70%。

Conclusion: 随着LLMs在科学内容摘要能力上的提升，开发能够准确检索或实时生成证据的系统将最大化其价值。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question
answering raises concerns about the accuracy and evidentiary support of their
responses. To address this, we present Answered with Evidence, a framework for
evaluating whether LLM-generated answers are grounded in scientific literature.
We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative
pipeline that included: (1) Alexandria, fka the Atropos Evidence Library, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive
model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Motivation: 罕见疾病由于低流行率和临床医生熟悉度不足，诊断困难。现有标签数据稀缺且存在偏差，需要一种能够结合高精度标签和广泛覆盖的方法。

Method: 使用Transformer架构，结合黄金标准标签和电子健康记录（EHR）衍生的银标准标签，通过医学概念嵌入和多层Transformer进行患者级表征。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展罕见疾病患者的识别和分层，为临床和研究提供支持。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了内在几何如何影响学习能力，为结构化数据领域的深度学习提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了毒理基因组学数据补全的准确性，还为跨物种药物研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix
toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional
structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic
measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database
with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future
studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to
humans.

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage
knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior
work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,
and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest
GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive
chatbots and robotic control.

decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and
trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the
highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and
Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven

Method: 通过组合必要性、拓扑必要性和经验必要性三个层面的论证，证明任何通用逼近器都无法避免灾难性失败。

Result: 研究表明，完美对齐是数学上不可能的，且实际任务本身具有灾难性，迫使模型学习这些不稳定性。

Conclusion: 论文将UAT安全问题从“如何实现完美控制”重新定义为“如何在不可约的不可控性下安全操作”，对UAT发展和治理有深远影响。

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

Result: 框架提供了数据效用与控制之间的权衡，揭示了监管盲点，为开发者、研究者和监管者提供指导。

Conclusion: 需重新思考现代AI技术中的数据保护，框架为未来技术和治理提供了结构化视角。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维不完整数据（HDI）在现实应用中广泛存在，但现有二阶潜在因子模型因目标函数的双线性和非凸性，需要复杂的参数调整。

Method: ACRSLF采用自调谐立方正则化和多Hessian-向量乘积评估，以动态缓解非凸优化不稳定性和精确吸收二阶信息。

Result: 在工业HDI数据集上的实验表明，ACRSLF收敛更快且表示精度更高。

Conclusion: ACRSLF在优化性能和精度上优于现有基于优化器的LFA模型。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

Result: 在五个实际复合系统中，Optimas平均性能提升11.92%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Optimas提供了一种通用有效的复合系统优化方法，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation
methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be
only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding,
being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

*Thomas A. Henzinger,Mahyar Karimi,Konstantin Kueffner,Kaushik Mallik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种运行时验证算法公平性的通用框架，适用于模型未知但具有马尔可夫链结构的系统，支持多种公平性属性的监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统在人类决策中广泛应用，确保其公平性（不基于敏感属性偏袒个体）至关重要。

Method: 引入一种规范语言建模常见公平性属性，并构建监控器实时评估系统公平性，提供定量估计。

Result: 监控器输出具有可变误差界限和置信水平的公平性估计，误差随观察序列增长而减小。实验显示监控器更新判决时间小于1毫秒。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效监控系统公平性，适用于多种场景，如银行贷款和大学录取的公平性评估。

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

*Egor Maximov,Yulia Kuzkina,Azamat Kanametov,Alexander Prutko,Aleksei Goncharov,Maxim Zhelnin,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了8:16半结构化稀疏方法，相比传统2:4稀疏方法，在保持性能的同时提供了更高的灵活性，并通过结构化稀疏模式处理异常权重，结合简单技术如方差校正和权重均衡进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）规模的增长，高效的压缩技术（如量化和稀疏化）变得至关重要。传统结构化稀疏方法（如N:M稀疏化）因灵活性和对异常权重的敏感性不足而表现不佳。

Method: 提出8:16半结构化稀疏方法，结合结构化稀疏模式处理异常权重，并应用方差校正和SmoothQuant类权重均衡技术。

Result: 8:16稀疏方法在性能阈值上超越未压缩或更小的模型，且相比2:4稀疏方法，存储开销更小（0.875 vs. 0.75 bits/element）。结构化稀疏对异常权重的处理与无结构化方法竞争性相当或更好。

Conclusion: 8:16半结构化稀疏方法在性能和灵活性上优于传统方法，结合简单技术可进一步提升稀疏模型的表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于多模态元学习模型和视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）对学生手绘图和文本的自动评分效果，发现元学习模型在二元分类任务中表现更好，而VLLMs在更复杂的三元分类任务中略胜一筹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线学习的兴起，数学评估需求增加，但针对手绘图的自动评分研究较少。

Method: 采用多模态元学习模型和VLLMs进行自动评分，并在真实数据集上比较性能。

Result: 元学习模型在二元分类任务中优于VLLMs，而VLLMs在复杂任务中表现略好。

Conclusion: VLLMs虽具潜力，但其可靠性和实用性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

*Hao Yang,Angela Yao,Christopher Whalen,Gengchen Mai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BERT4Traj是一种基于Transformer的模型，用于从稀疏移动数据中重建完整的人类移动轨迹，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动数据通常因采集方法限制而稀疏，影响其在公共卫生、交通和城市规划中的应用。

Method: BERT4Traj结合空间嵌入、时间嵌入和上下文背景特征（如人口统计和锚点），利用BERT的掩码语言建模目标和自注意力机制。

Result: 在乌干达坎帕拉的真实CDR和GPS数据集上，BERT4Traj显著优于马尔可夫链、KNN、RNN和LSTM等传统模型。

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能有效重建详细且连续的移动轨迹，提升对人类移动模式的理解。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine (C²HM)，通过目标驱动的非对称推理改进传统Helmholtz Machine，支持记忆链和空间组合想象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Helmholtz Machine依赖对称的数据驱动更新，限制了其目标导向推理和时序扩展模拟能力。

Method: C²HM将推理重构为目标驱动的非对称过程，通过前向生成和逆向细化的循环一致性机制，结合变分循环实现目标与观测的对齐。

Result: C²HM提高了表征效率，支持路径依赖推理的记忆链，并实现空间组合想象。

Conclusion: C²HM为生成建模提供了生物启发的替代方案，将记忆规划和无监督学习统一在概率框架中。

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了强化学习中目标泛化错误的问题，比较了最大期望值（MEV）和最小最大期望遗憾（MMER）目标下的表现，发现MMER方法更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标泛化错误的动机是确保学习策略在新环境中不仅表现良好，还能正确追求设计者的目标，而非代理目标。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较了MEV和MMER目标在程序生成的网格世界环境中的表现。

Result: MEV方法在训练中可能引发目标泛化错误，而MMER方法（如UED）表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 最小最大期望遗憾（MMER）是缓解目标泛化错误的有效方法。

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

TL;DR: NeuralDMD结合神经隐式表示与动态模式分解（DMD），从稀疏、噪声的测量中重建连续时空动态，并在实际应用中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学成像常面临从未见过的动态系统，且测量数据稀疏、噪声大，传统方法难以处理。

Method: NeuralDMD结合神经网络的表达能力与DMD的线性动态模式，实现复杂动态的低维表示与预测。

Result: 在风速场重建和银河中心黑洞等离子体演化恢复中，NeuralDMD优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是一种通用工具，适用于地球科学、天文学等领域的动态系统成像。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法通常仅支持显式或隐式关系，且缺乏对重复结构模式的利用，SymMatika旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SymMatika采用多岛遗传编程和可重用模式库，通过反馈驱动进化引擎和隐式导数指标支持显式和隐式关系发现。

Result: 在基准测试中，SymMatika表现优异，恢复率比现有方法高5.1%，并首次恢复Nguyen-12，同时在Feynman方程上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: SymMatika展示了结构感知进化搜索在科学发现中的潜力，并开源以支持可解释建模和符号发现研究。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results
demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific
discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic
discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

Result: BLaST在MLP权重上实现95%稀疏化且精度损失可忽略，速度提升达16.7倍，内存使用减少3.12倍。

Conclusion: BLaST通过降低能耗、内存占用和延迟，推动下一代大规模AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement
- shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable sparsification method applicable to linear layers in all
settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss. Our fused, highly optimized Sparse MLP kernel
delivers up to 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs across 9 architectures and 8
datasets, resulting in up to 1.6x inference speedup, 1.11x pretraining speedup
and up to 3.12x inference memory usage reduction. BLaST enables the next
generation of large-scale AI systems by reducing energy use, memory footprint,
and latency.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Result: LLMs表现出选择支持性偏见，对不一致建议反应过度，偏离贝叶斯更新规范。

Conclusion: LLMs的固执和对批评的过度敏感源于其一致性维护机制和对矛盾反馈的过敏反应。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

Conclusion: 集合值预测为领域泛化提供了一种有前景的方向，能够提升模型在未见领域的性能。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust
domain generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型推理受限于GPU内存，尤其是长上下文生成所需的KV缓存。现有方法未能充分利用CPU计算资源或牺牲准确性。

Method: HGCA结合GPU上的密集注意力和CPU上的并行稀疏注意力，通过log-sum-exp融合输出，并采用细粒度稀疏化策略优化CPU执行。

Result: HGCA在多种模型和任务中表现出卓越的可扩展性，支持更长序列和更大批量，性能和准确性均优于现有稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: HGCA在无需重新训练模型的情况下，显著提升了大规模语言模型推理的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

TL;DR: PiCME提出了一种多模态对比学习方法，用于临床预测，通过整合五种数据类型，并引入Modality-Gated LSTM解决多模态性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态深度学习在临床预测中潜力巨大，但现有方法主要局限于图像和文本对，缺乏对多种数据类型的系统性整合。

Method: 提出PiCME框架，预训练26种两到五模态组合的对比模型，并引入Modality-Gated LSTM动态加权各模态。

Result: 对比模型在三模态下表现优异，五模态时性能下降但通过Modality-Gated LSTM提升（AUROC从73.19%到76.93%）。

Conclusion: PiCME为多模态临床预测提供了系统性指导，尤其在公平性和可解释性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

Result: 该方法在形状识别、抗图像干扰和对抗攻击方面表现优于现有高参数模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化学习方式而非增加数据量，可以实现更高效、更接近人类视觉的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Method: LaTF框架将状态预测信息瓶颈（SPIB）与归一化流（NFs）结合，联合优化表示学习和生成建模，学习低维潜在变量（CVs）并生成平衡分布。

Conclusion: LaTF能够通过学习低维潜在变量和生成模型，准确再现系统的平衡行为，并在有限数据下表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI
systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose
future research directions to further advance the application of
transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

TL;DR: DistZO2是一个高效、内存优化的分布式零阶微调框架，通过并行策略和硬件感知通信提升LLM微调吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ZO2框架在单设备执行和吞吐量上的限制，扩展零阶优化在多GPU系统中的应用。

Method: 引入三种并行策略：PertP、DDP和2D Parallelism，并结合硬件感知通信优化参数卸载。

Result: 在OPT-175B上实现3倍速度提升，保持内存效率。

Conclusion: DistZO2显著提升零阶微调效率，适用于现代多GPU系统。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in

TL;DR: 论文提出通过神经抑制改进动态路由模型，提升深度学习的效率与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态路由模型需要基于神经元群体的信号选择架构，但现有方法缺乏对共享信号的抑制，限制了路径选择的效率。

Method: 引入神经抑制算法，抑制数据统计模式中的共享信号，使路由模型能为每个数据样本选择专用路径。

Result: 实验证明神经抑制算法显著提升了通用任务的性能。

Conclusion: 神经抑制是实现混合专家、动态路由和Transformer语言模型的有效方法，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于共形预测集的顺序查询策略（C-IP），用于优化LLM在问答任务中的查询效率，相比传统方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的信息追求（IP）策略在LLM中因概率估计不准确导致查询选择不佳，需要一种更稳健的替代方法。

Method: 提出C-IP，利用共形预测集与条件熵的关系，通过预测集的平均大小估计不确定性。

Result: 在20 Questions和MediQ数据集上，C-IP表现优于传统IP和不确定性链式思维方法，且更具可解释性。

Conclusion: C-IP是一种分布无关且稳健的替代方法，显著提升了LLM在交互式问答中的性能。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

Motivation: 研究旨在验证动态大气变量的低秩近似可行性，并填补Sentinel-5P数据中的缺失值。

Method: 采用基于CP分解和交替最小二乘法的低秩张量模型（LRTM）进行数据填补，并与地统计学空间插值方法进行比较。

Result: LRTM成功重建了缺失值，尤其在云层遮挡、预测异常值和识别热点区域时表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在扩展的时空尺度上，低秩张量模型能有效填补动态大气变量的缺失数据。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

Conclusion: GVI-DA在理论和实践上均表现出色，为领域自适应提供了高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多粒度自适应参数分配方法（MGAA），用于大语言模型（LLM）的低秩近似压缩，通过自适应分配压缩比例提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩近似压缩方法通常对所有权重矩阵采用统一压缩比例，忽视了其对模型性能的差异化影响，且现有启发式搜索策略计算效率低且泛化能力差。

Method: MGAA方法包括两部分：1）在不同子层间基于输入输出的余弦相似度分配压缩比例；2）在子层内基于权重矩阵的能量分布特性分配压缩比例。

Result: 在多个LLM骨干模型和基准数据集上的评估表明MGAA性能优越，且在多模态模型LLaVA上应用后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MGAA通过自适应参数分配显著提升了低秩近似压缩的效果，适用于LLM和多模态模型。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对象中心世界模型在视觉复杂度有限的环境中表现良好，但在复杂纹理和杂乱场景中的泛化能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出Dyn-O，通过改进对象中心表示的学习和动态建模，直接从像素观测中学习对象中心世界模型。

Result: 在Procgen游戏中，Dyn-O在滚动预测准确性上优于DreamerV3，并能生成更多样化的想象轨迹。

Conclusion: Dyn-O展示了对象中心世界模型在复杂环境中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

Abstract: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are central to combinatorial optimization
with significant practical implications. Recent advancements in neural
combinatorial optimization (NCO) have demonstrated promising results by
leveraging neural networks to solve VRPs, yet the exploration of model scaling
within this domain remains underexplored. Inspired by the success of model
scaling in large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a Large Routing

results. Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP
challenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing
models. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models
from 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple
model factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal
configurations for foundation neural routing solvers.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，ReTimeCausal在采样不规则和缺失数据条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal有效解决了不规则时间序列因果发现的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in sequential
decision tasks. However, recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of RL
policies to different perturbations, raising concerns about their effectiveness
and safety in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on the robustness
of RL policies against action perturbations and introduce a novel framework
called Optimal Adversary-aware Policy Iteration (OA-PI). Our framework enhances
action robustness under various perturbations by evaluating and improving
policy performance against the corresponding optimal adversaries. Besides, our
approach can be integrated into mainstream DRL algorithms such as Twin Delayed
DDPG (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improving action robustness
effectively while maintaining nominal performance and sample efficiency.
Experimental results across various environments demonstrate that our method
enhances robustness of DRL policies against different action adversaries
effectively.

Result: 通过分类整理指标，为从业者提供了选择合适评估工具的依据。

Conclusion: 该综述提升了模型评估的准确性，并促进了跨模型和跨应用的比较。

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves
individual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across
different models and applications.

Conclusion: $z$-变换是一种强大的工具，适用于多种优化算法的渐近分析，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency
analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how
large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making
processes.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and
related fields. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle
to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this
work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that
integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly
model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular
fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of
interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further
reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns,
supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular

Conclusion: 结合形状信息的混合方法能生成更稳健的分子表示，为分子机器学习开辟新途径。

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and
code used in this work.

Abstract: ObjectRL is an open-source Python codebase for deep reinforcement learning
(RL), designed for research-oriented prototyping with minimal programming
effort. Unlike existing codebases, ObjectRL is built on Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) principles, providing a clear structure that simplifies the
implementation, modification, and evaluation of new algorithms. ObjectRL lowers
the entry barrier for deep RL research by organizing best practices into
explicit, clearly separated components, making them easier to understand and
adapt. Each algorithmic component is a class with attributes that describe key
RL concepts and methods that intuitively reflect their interactions. The class
hierarchy closely follows common ontological relationships, enabling data
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are core features of OOP.
We demonstrate the efficiency of ObjectRL's design through representative use
cases that highlight its flexibility and suitability for rapid prototyping. The

Conclusion: MAFG框架为科学数据的特征生成提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法对所有网络层使用统一学习率，可能忽略了各部分的独特动态，因此需要一种更灵活的学习率调整方法。

Method: 引入相对学习率（RLRS），针对不同组件动态调整学习率，参数可从小模型调优后迁移到大模型。

Result: 训练速度提升高达23%，在复杂模型（如MoE）中表现显著，参数可迁移到27倍大的模型。

Conclusion: RLRS方法简单高效，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，为大规模神经网络优化提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution
for optimizing large-scale neural networks.

Conclusion: 该框架为开发更强大的表格基础模型提供了支持。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中高维梯度传输和DP噪声随维度增长的问题。

Method: 使用紧凑草图将梯度投影到低维空间，并添加随机探针防止草图退化。

Result: 通信成本从d降到k，梯度近似误差为σ²k，满足(ε,δ)-DP。

Conclusion: DOME有效降低了通信和噪声成本，同时确保隐私保护。

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

Conclusion: KLDM为晶体材料生成提供了一种有效的扩散模型，解决了对称性和多模态问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

Method: 使用因子化的蒙特卡洛Dropout框架，将总预测方差分解为共享编码器中的表示不确定性（sigma_rep）和结果头中的预测不确定性（sigma_pred）。

Result: 在合成协变量偏移情况下，区间校准良好（ECE < 0.03），且满足sigma_rep^2 + sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2。在真实世界双胞胎队列中，表示不确定性在分布外样本中显著增加。

Conclusion: 模块级分解为深度因果效应模型中的不确定性来源提供了实用的诊断工具。

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建多尺度脑模型提供了新途径，填补了单神经元动力学与宏观脑活动之间的空白。

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain
anomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up. MLASDO is an open-source
R package available at: https://github.com/JoseAdrian3/MLASDO.

Motivation: 科学应用需要实时替代模型来捕捉多物理场系统的行为，但现有神经操作器框架在多物理场问题中的应用尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过评估DeepONet及其变体在单物理场、弱耦合和强耦合多物理场系统中的表现，比较单分支和多分支架构的性能。

Result: 实验表明，强耦合系统中单分支网络显著优于多分支网络，而多分支架构在解耦或单物理场问题中更具优势。替代模型预测速度比高保真有限元求解器快1.8e4倍。

Conclusion: 神经操作器的架构设计应与物理耦合强度对齐，以实现高效且准确的预测。

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在包含安全漏洞的代码上微调大型语言模型（LLM）可能导致模型行为偏离预期并产生广泛的不安全行为。通过实验分析，作者认为这种“涌现性失准”实际上是先前对齐的削弱，并识别了一个控制对齐行为的共享潜在维度。

Motivation: 探讨窄域微调如何影响LLM的内部机制和行为表现，以解释先前观察到的失准现象。

Method: 通过实验分析输出概率分布、损失和梯度向量几何、逐层激活动态以及激活空间维度。

Result: 微调不安全代码会引发与对齐相悖的内部变化，并识别出一个共享潜在维度，该维度在模型激活空间中被不安全代码和失准响应激活。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了窄域微调如何通过干扰共享内部机制削弱模型的安全性，强调了需要更鲁棒的微调策略以保持跨域预期行为。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by
directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

Motivation: 传统CFA工具虽然准确，但资源密集且难以推广，研究旨在通过AI技术克服这些限制。

Method: 使用LLM为600个初创企业路演文本生成CFA评分，并以此训练机器学习分类模型。

Result: 最佳模型预测准确率达85%，且与人工评估显著相关（Spearman's r = 0.896）。

Conclusion: AI与CFA结合提供了可扩展、可靠且低偏见的评估方法，解决了传统工具的局限性。

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

Motivation: 现有方法通过重新训练模型来减少偏差，但FAROS直接在生成过程中优化公平性，无需重新训练。

Method: FAROS通过计算最优切换节点比例，并在特定扩散步骤切换敏感属性，同时保持节点拓扑分布和边独立性。

Result: 实验表明FAROS在减少公平性差异的同时保持或提高准确性，并在某些情况下优于其他方法。

Conclusion: FAROS通过多标准约束在公平性和准确性之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评分器（LLM-as-a-judge）虽然可扩展，但存在可靠性不一和系统偏差的问题，需要一种方法同时评估评分器并解决研究问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯GLM模型，将评分结果建模为评分器和被评项目属性的函数，量化评分差异和偏差。

Result: 该方法能够提供不确定性估计，明确分歧来源，并增强传统可靠性指标（如评分者间一致性）。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了自动评分器在LLM评估中的稳健性和可解释性，支持性能分析和偏差检测。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

Conclusion: GNN-Ceff为VLSI设计提供了一种高效且准确的有效电容建模方法。

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the
state-of-the-art method run serially.

Motivation: LLM在资源受限环境中部署困难，传统低秩压缩假设权重矩阵低秩，但LLM的激活更具低秩结构，需优化激活重建。

Method: 提出IMPACT框架，结合激活结构和梯度敏感性，通过重要性加权激活协方差矩阵的特征向量优化重建基。

Result: 实验显示IMPACT在多种模型和任务中，模型大小减少高达48.6%，准确性接近最优基线。

Conclusion: IMPACT通过重要性感知的激活重建，显著提升低秩压缩效果，适用于资源受限的LLM部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: MatRL生成的算法在数值实验中优于文献中的多种基线方法，并能泛化到同一分布的大矩阵。

Conclusion: MatRL为矩阵函数计算提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，具有理论和实验支持。

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

Result: 在Alps超级计算机上，实现了128 GPU的强扩展和512 GPU的弱扩展，并行效率达87%。

Conclusion: 分布式eGNN为大规模材料电子结构预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维回归中ICD-10代码作为预测变量时，普通最小二乘法（OLS）模型系数不稳定且难以平衡准确性和一致性的问题。

Method: 通过截断ICD-10代码的字符数（如从7个字符减少到6个或更少），降低回归问题的维度，同时保留所有诊断代码类别的表示。

Result: 减少ICD-10代码的粒度提高了OLS回归的系数稳定性，同时保持了模型的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 减少ICD-10代码的粒度是一种有效的正则化策略，解释了为何在现实世界的风险调整和成本模型中更倾向于使用较宽泛的诊断分组（如DRGs和HCC代码）。

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在量子化学中通常局限于中性、闭壳层分子，无法处理复杂特性（如电荷、自旋和环境效应）。

Method: OrbitAll利用自旋极化轨道特征，结合满足SE(3)-等变性的图神经网络，构建物理信息架构。

Conclusion: OrbitAll通过物理信息架构实现了对复杂分子系统的高效准确表示和预测。

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their
representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell
molecules. However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex
characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We
introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework
that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information.
OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum
mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying
SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any
molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects.
OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting
charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating
to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a
physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10
times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of
approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于低维流形的Latent FxLMS方法，通过自编码器约束自适应滤波器权重，提升了传统FxLMS在主动噪声控制中的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FxLMS在主动噪声控制中需要高维权重调整，效率较低。利用噪声源空间区域的先验知识，通过低维流形优化权重可以提高效率。

Method: 训练自编码器对稳态自适应滤波器的权重进行编码和解码，约束权重为解码器输出，并在潜在空间更新权重。

Result: 在某些条件下，Latent FxLMS比标准FxLMS收敛更快，稳态均方误差相当。

Conclusion: Latent FxLMS方法通过低维流形优化权重，显著提升了收敛速度，为主动噪声控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

TL;DR: TK-GCN是一个两阶段框架，结合几何感知的空间编码和长程时间建模，用于不规则几何域上的时空动态预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不规则几何域上复杂空间相关性和非线性时间动态的联合建模问题。

Method: 第一阶段使用K-GCN将高维动态嵌入近似线性的潜在空间；第二阶段用Transformer建模潜在空间中的时间依赖。

Result: 在心脏时空动态预测中，TK-GCN表现出优于现有方法的预测准确性。

Conclusion: TK-GCN能有效建模复杂空间结构和非线性时间动态，适用于长程预测。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: 高阶PINNs模型在解决ODE参数不确定性问题上具有潜力，尤其在控制应用中表现优异。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

Conclusion: 集成方法在多种物理系统中表现出鲁棒性，可作为高效准确的替代方案。

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

Conclusion: 神经网络泛化能力源于局部极值动态映射，极值增量算法为优化提供新思路。

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from
the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm.
Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be
reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.

Abstract: We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both

models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to
generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional
representations that capture their underlying structure. Applying machine
learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and
predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike
existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require
fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and
broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through
three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2)
estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral
outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An
open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）早期检测对延缓病情进展至关重要，但现有方法在纵向预测中面临挑战。

Method: 使用Transformer模型，基于患者历史就诊序列预测AD进展阶段，并与RNN模型（LSTM、GRU等）进行对比。

Result: 模型在数据缺失和特征缺失情况下表现优异，尤其在识别病情恶化患者方面优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 该模型有望提升AD早期诊断效果，改善患者预后。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种领域的在线和离线环境中均优于现有风险敏感方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为风险敏感强化学习提供了一种更灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation in the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
is a powerful framework for optimisation tasks over complex structured domains,
such as the space of scientifically interesting molecules. However, existing
approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead
to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific
tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

Conclusion: CAPIMAC有效提升了不平衡和不对齐多模态数据融合的质量。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at
https://github.com/Autism-mm/CAPIMAC.git.

Conclusion: mol-infer-GNN框架结合GNN的优势，显著提升了分子推断的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

Conclusion: MCST-Mamba在交通预测中表现出色，更贴近实际拥堵场景。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning
methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model

features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of
research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between
heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark

Method: 利用少量精选的大型真实数据集进行继续预训练，而非使用更广泛但可能噪声较多的语料库。

Result: Real-TabPFN在OpenML AutoML Benchmark的29个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 针对性的继续预训练可以有效提升表格数据基础模型的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, like TabPFN, achieve strong performance
on small datasets when pre-trained solely on synthetic data. We show that this
performance can be significantly boosted by a targeted continued pre-training
phase. Specifically, we demonstrate that leveraging a small, curated collection
of large, real-world datasets for continued pre-training yields superior
downstream predictive accuracy compared to using broader, potentially noisier
corpora like CommonCrawl or GitTables. Our resulting model, Real-TabPFN,
achieves substantial performance gains on 29 datasets from the OpenML AutoML
Benchmark.

*Seongyun Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、可边缘部署的管道，用于检测化学和生物实验室中的传感器异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室传感器异常检测需要快速适应新液体或传感器的能力，同时保持低延迟和小数据需求。

Method: 使用定制PCB捕获七个传感器通道，并通过本地网络传输数据。采用基于注意力机制的一类自编码器，仅需30分钟正常数据训练即可使用。

Result: 模型在小数据集上表现良好，F1分数为0.72，精度为0.89，召回率为0.61。训练后的网络转换为31 kB的TensorFlow-Lite二进制文件，在边缘设备上运行，延迟低于2秒。

Conclusion: 整个工作流程在一小时内完成，展示了管道快速适应新液体或传感器的能力。

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor
anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories. A custom PCB captures seven
sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based
One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty
minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains
an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on
synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a
TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a
fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency
stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes
within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a
new liquid or sensor is introduced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于树的嵌入方法，改进Transformer模型在源代码表示中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置嵌入无法充分捕捉源代码的层次结构（如AST）。

Method: 提出树形位置嵌入，编码AST的层次关系，并集成到CodeBERTa模型中。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的模型在MLM和克隆检测任务中表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 显式结构信息对Transformer源代码表示至关重要。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated significant success in various
source code representation tasks. Nonetheless, traditional positional
embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical
structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional
embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived
from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical
embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically
enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model
through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection
fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced
CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy,
F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating
explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of
source code.

Motivation: 现有城市社会经济建模多依赖局部特征，忽略了网络效应，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 在12个美国主要城市的实验中，模型性能优于传统机器学习方法。

Conclusion: 研究为城市建模提供了网络效应整合方法，对政策制定和规划具有启示意义。

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

Abstract: The ability to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with constraints is
instrumental in improving the fairness of modern machine-learning models. Many
algorithms have been analysed in recent years, and yet there is no standard,
widely accepted method for the constrained training of DNNs. In this paper, we
provide a challenging benchmark of real-world large-scale fairness-constrained
learning tasks, built on top of the US Census (Folktables). We point out the
theoretical challenges of such tasks and review the main approaches in
stochastic approximation algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the
benchmark by implementing and comparing three recently proposed, but as-of-yet
unimplemented, algorithms both in terms of optimization performance, and
fairness improvement. We release the code of the benchmark as a Python package

Conclusion: 研究提供了实用的方程，可用于SAT操作的实时监测和长期规划，同时强调了季节性温度循环和表土温度的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of effluent temperature in recharge basins is essential
for optimizing the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) process, as temperature
directly influences water viscosity and infiltration rates. This study develops
and evaluates predictive models for effluent temperature in the upper recharge
layer of a Shafdan SAT system recharge basin using ambient meteorological data.
Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF)
were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model,
preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high
predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent
temperatures over a 10-year period. Results highlight pronounced seasonal
temperature cycles and the importance of topsoil temperature in governing the
thermal profile of the infiltrating effluent. The study provides practical

*Chenyang Ren,Yifan Jia,Huanyi Xie,Zhaobin Xu,Tianxing Wei,Liangyu Wang,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种基于影响函数（IF）的数据评估方法，用于解决Sharpness-aware Minimization（SAM）中的数据影响评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM通过损失景观几何提升泛化能力，但面临噪声数据和隐私问题，现有数据影响评估工具（如IF）无法直接应用于SAM的双层计算结构。

Method: 开发了两种创新方法：基于Hessian的IF和基于梯度轨迹的IF，分别适用于不同场景。

Result: 实验证明这两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，可用于识别错误标签数据、模型编辑和增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为SAM中的数据影响评估提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dreamer算法的潜在空间压缩可能导致关键信息丢失，影响智能体性能。现有方法如Δ-IRIS和DIAMOND虽改进模型准确性，但需从像素直接训练，效率低下且无法利用世界模型内部表示。

Method: EMERALD使用空间潜在状态和MaskGIT预测生成潜在空间中的轨迹，结合高效掩码策略。

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中，EMERALD以10M环境步数超越人类专家表现，并首次解锁全部22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD提供了一种高效且准确的世界建模方法，显著提升智能体性能。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Result: 不同注意力层对输入数据的关系假设不同，分类揭示了其内在特性。

Conclusion: 注意力机制的关系偏置可通过几何深度学习视角分类，为模型设计提供理论依据。

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine
generalization capacity. In this work, we focus on characterizing the
relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

### [205] [When Data-Free Knowledge Distillation Meets Non-Transferable Teacher: Escaping Out-of-Distribution Trap is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04119)
*Ziming Hong,Runnan Chen,Zengmao Wang,Bo Han,Bo Du,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对抗陷阱逃逸（ATEsc）方法，用于在数据无知识蒸馏（DFKD）中过滤误导性OOD样本，以提升对不可信教师的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFKD方法假设教师模型可信，但实际中教师可能具有非可迁移学习（NTL）特性，导致生成器关注误导性OOD知识而非有用ID知识。

Method: 通过分析NTL教师对OOD样本的更强对抗鲁棒性，将合成样本分为脆弱组（ID-like）和鲁棒组（OOD-like），分别用于知识蒸馏和遗忘OOD知识。

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD对NTL教师的性能。

Conclusion: ATEsc通过识别和过滤OOD样本，解决了DFKD中NTL教师带来的问题，为无数据知识蒸馏提供了更安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.
Code is released at https://github.com/tmllab/2025_ICML_ATEsc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GNNs与Transformers在编码策略上的相似性，探索在无相对位置信息时GNNs是否能替代Transformers。

Method: 比较GNNs与Transformers的异同，设计合成示例验证其等价性，并在单细胞转录组学数据集上进行实验。

Result: GNNs在无相对位置信息时性能与Transformers相当，且计算资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: GNNs在特定领域（如单细胞转录组学）可替代Transformers，挑战了Transformers为最优选择的普遍观点。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is
always the optimum choice.

Motivation: 提升Tsetlin机器的可解释性，通过概率评分和不确定性量化技术，使其预测更加透明和可靠。

Method: 分析TM学习动态，推导概率评分；通过模拟数据和CIFAR-10数据集验证技术有效性。

Result: TM的概率评分与数据基础概率相关，且在训练数据域外预测时表现出较低置信度。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化技术为TM提供了新的解释维度，并指出了图像分类模型的改进方向。

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

Abstract: Differentiable programming that enables automatic differentiation through

computing, supporting both forward and inverse modeling and facilitating
integration with deep learning frameworks. We present JAX-MPM, a
general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum
mechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic
material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard
applications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using
the JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly
through time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models
and neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural
constitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,
including dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and
performance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million
particles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98
seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we
demonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction
and spatially varying friction estimation. These results establish JAX-MPM as a

Motivation: 空气污染对全球城市健康构成严重威胁，科克市的二氧化氮水平远超世界卫生组织标准，亟需准确预测工具以支持城市规划和预警系统。

Method: 研究结合十年空气监测数据和三十年天气记录，评估了17种机器学习算法，最终选择Extra Trees作为最优模型。

Result: Extra Trees算法预测准确率达77%，显著优于传统方法。研究发现气象条件（温度、风速、湿度）是主要污染驱动因素，交通和季节变化导致污染周期性波动。2014至2022年间，科克市空气质量改善了31%。

Conclusion: 智能预测系统可为城市规划和环境管理提供有力工具，支持早期预警和决策制定，改善城市空气质量。

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization
safety standards by up to $278\%$. This study leverages artificial intelligence
to predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten
years of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather
records. We evaluated 17 machine learning algorithms, with Extra Trees emerging
as the optimal solution, achieving $77\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly
outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that
meteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity
are the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and
seasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits
dramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,
and daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's
air quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models
detected an encouraging $31\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research
demonstrates that intelligent forecasting systems can provide city planners and
environmental officials with powerful prediction tools, enabling life-saving
early warning systems and informed urban planning decisions. The technology
exists today to transform urban air quality management. All research materials

Result: 明确了前向过程噪声对学习预测器的贡献，并提供了基本等式的新理论解释。

Conclusion: 研究为扩散模型的结构提供了新的理论见解，并验证了基本等式的正确性。

Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise
predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the
forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log
q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and
mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its
origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的遗忘方法Partial Model Collapse (PMC)，通过部分模型崩溃实现敏感数据的遗忘，无需在目标中包含遗忘数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在遗忘目标中包含敏感数据，可能强化其暴露，且违背最小化使用原则。

Method: 利用生成模型在自身生成数据上训练导致分布崩溃的现象，部分触发崩溃以实现遗忘。

Result: 理论分析表明PMC能收敛到遗忘目标，实验显示其更有效移除私有信息。

Conclusion: PMC为更全面的遗忘方法提供了重要进展，符合实际隐私约束。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

TL;DR: CP-Composer是一种生成框架，通过几何约束实现零样本环肽生成，解决了环肽设计数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环肽因其几何约束具有优于线性肽的生化特性，但目标特异性环肽设计因数据不足而受限。

Method: 提出CP-Composer框架，将复杂环化模式分解为单元约束，通过几何条件扩散模型生成环肽。

Result: 模型能生成多样化的目标结合环肽，成功率在38%至84%之间。

Conclusion: CP-Composer为环肽设计提供了有效工具，解决了数据不足的挑战。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于张量的归一化迭代硬阈值方法（TNIHT），用于从有限线性测量中恢复低秩张量，支持CP和Tucker两种分解模型，并提供了理论收敛性和实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩感知理论表明稀疏信号可以从不完全测量中准确重建，而迭代阈值算法（如NIHT）在矩阵恢复中广泛应用。本文旨在将NIHT扩展到张量领域，以解决高阶低秩张量的恢复问题。

Method: 提出TNIHT方法，支持CP和Tucker两种张量分解模型，利用张量的低维结构实现高效重建，并在TRIP条件下建立收敛定理。

Result: 通过合成数据、图像和视频数据的实验验证，TNIHT在恢复低秩张量方面表现优于现有算法。

Conclusion: TNIHT是一种有效的低秩张量恢复方法，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

*Carles Gelada,Jacob Buckman,Sean Zhang,Txus Bach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“power attention”的线性成本序列建模层，解决了传统Transformer和次二次架构在长序列训练中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer处理长序列时成本过高，而次二次架构成本过低，滑动窗口注意力等方法又损害了上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入power attention层，其状态大小可独立于参数调整，并开发了高效的GPU内核以避免内存和带宽瓶颈。

Result: 实验表明，power attention在长上下文训练中优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: power attention是一种有效的长序列建模解决方案，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Method: 利用多样查询的内部激活模式，通过微调单一模型层来精确调整触发拒绝的激活组件。

Result: 在多个基准测试中有效减少过度拒绝，同时保持对有害查询的处理能力和整体实用性。

Conclusion: ACTOR提供了一种高效且鲁棒的方法，优化了LLM的安全对齐，减少了不必要的拒绝行为。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Result: Retformer在多项性能指标上优于基准算法，最高提升11%。

Conclusion: Retformer为AD早期诊断提供了一种高效且可解释的方法，验证了视网膜图像的潜力。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

activations without any gradient back propagation. Unlike traditional
finetuning, QF updates are computed in closed form, require minimal parameter

Motivation: 流体系统的高维、非线性和多尺度特性使得反馈控制复杂化，而实际应用中往往只能获取部分测量数据。

Result: 在模拟环境中成功减少了简化道路车辆的空气阻力，并确定了最优历史长度和控制策略架构。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中传感器受限的场景提供了有效的控制策略实现途径。

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有异构联邦学习方法，原型分离效果更好。

Conclusion: ProtoNorm继承了PBFL的通信效率，适合资源受限的环境，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly
suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在资源受限环境中通信效率低的问题，尤其是原型方法在大特征维度和多类别时的效率下降。

Result: 实验显示TinyProto通信成本降低4倍，性能不降，且无客户端计算开销。

Conclusion: TinyProto高效、适用于异构联邦学习，是资源受限环境的理想选择。

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment

where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same

showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and
cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address
this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling
Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is
applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both

improvements with CLAGA.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models
remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many
model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall
short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping
contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator
accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential
use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based
on interaction analysis.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法（如MAE和对比学习）忽视了农业景观的时间特性（如自然周期），因此需要针对农业场景设计更有效的预训练任务。

Method: 提出三种农业特定预训练任务：时间差异预测（TD）、时间频率预测（FP）和未来帧预测（FF）。

Result: 在SICKLE数据集上，FF在作物分类任务中达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE；FF在印度全国尺度上表现优异，IoU达54.2%。

Conclusion: 农业特定预训练任务显著提升了遥感基础模型在农业场景中的性能，验证了时间特性的重要性。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

Conclusion: 验证了基于强化学习的特征选择方法在恶意软件分类中的有效性，实现了高精度和计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果图的层次强化学习方法，通过因果发现算法学习子目标结构，并利用因果模型优先干预重要子目标，显著提高了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层次强化学习（HRL）在稀疏奖励的长时程任务中效率较低，主要挑战在于如何高效发现子目标的层次结构并利用其实现最终目标。

Method: 将子目标结构建模为因果图，提出因果发现算法学习该结构，并基于因果模型优先干预重要子目标。

Result: 在树结构和Erdős-Rényi随机图变体上，方法显著提高了效率；实验表明框架在训练成本上优于现有工作。

Conclusion: 通过因果建模和针对性干预，论文提出的框架在HRL任务中实现了更高的训练效率，并提供了理论分析支持。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) improves the efficiency of
long-horizon reinforcement-learning tasks with sparse rewards by decomposing
the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了自动编码概率电路（APCs），一种利用概率电路（PCs）的可处理性显式建模概率嵌入的新框架。APCs通过联合建模数据和嵌入，在重建质量、嵌入生成和缺失数据处理方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率电路（PCs）在推理任务中表现强大，但其在表示学习中的应用尚未充分探索。现有方法依赖外部神经嵌入或基于激活的编码，存在局限性。

Method: 提出APCs框架，扩展PCs以联合建模数据和嵌入，通过可处理的概率推理获取嵌入表示。结合神经解码器，形成可端到端训练的混合架构。

Result: APCs在重建质量上优于现有PC方法，生成的嵌入与神经自动编码器竞争，且在缺失数据处理上表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: APCs是一种强大且灵活的表示学习方法，利用PCs的概率推理能力，为鲁棒推理、分布外检测和知识蒸馏提供了新方向。

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 研究如何通过观察代理行为推断其效用函数，并扩展至噪声环境和自适应场景。

Method: 第一章使用经典显示偏好理论；第二章研究贝叶斯IRL；第三章提出基于Langevin动力学的自适应IRL算法。

Result: 成功重构代理效用函数，识别认知雷达和贝叶斯最优检测器，并实现实时跟踪时变效用函数。

Conclusion: IRL方法在噪声和动态环境中具有潜力，为行为分析和决策建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

Method: 提出一个通用策略学习框架，将其转化为非欧几里得空间的一阶优化问题，并分析了三种算法的收敛性：最速下降策略优化、保守策略迭代的Frank-Wolfe方法解释，以及策略镜像下降的在线实现。

Result: 在满足变分梯度主导（VGD）条件的凸策略类下，获得了三种算法的样本复杂度上限，并通过实验验证了VGD条件的实际相关性。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了所提框架和算法的有效性，尤其是在较弱假设下的适用性。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting,
where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the
best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

Result: 在腾讯应用商店和公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，下游任务性能提升10.70%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且已成功部署，显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public
datasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the
multilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream
task--credit risk management of user--improve its performance by 10.70% with
regard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法通常针对单点贪婪生成的有害响应，忽略了语言模型的随机性，因此需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 将攻击过程建模为优化与采样之间的资源分配问题，确定计算最优权衡，并将采样集成到现有攻击中以提升效果。

Result: 集成采样后攻击成功率提升48%，效率提升两个数量级；发现大多数优化策略对输出危害性影响有限。

Conclusion: 尾部感知的攻击和评估协议对准确评估和增强语言模型安全性至关重要。

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架和梯度流训练方法，分析特征核的适应性，并通过弹性权重耦合控制特征重用。

Result: 理论和实验揭示了弹性权重耦合、特征学习强度、数据集大小以及任务对齐对迁移学习效用的影响。

Conclusion: 迁移学习的效用受多种因素影响，弹性权重耦合和任务对齐是关键因素。

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

<details>

Motivation: 传统RLHF方法在LLM对齐中存在高计算成本、内存需求和训练不稳定的问题，尤其是在大规模模型上。

Method: 提出ESSA框架，利用ES进行对齐，结合低秩适应降低优化维度。

Result: ESSA在数学推理任务中表现优于梯度方法（如GRPO），收敛更快且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: ES为LLM对齐提供了一种高效、可扩展的替代方案，适用于大规模模型的后训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The
primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility
function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

Method: 提出LoSiA，动态定位并优化关键参数，通过梯度稀疏分析识别子网络作为训练目标。

Result: LoSiA在性能接近全微调的同时，训练时间最短，LoSiA-Pro比LoRA快27%。

Conclusion: LoSiA在减少遗忘和计算效率方面表现优异，适用于领域专业化和常识推理任务。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

Result: 在基准数据集和心脏病学应用中，NS在检测准确性和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NS框架通过不确定性驱动的决策过程，在医疗等领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

Result: DOTResize在多个LLM家族和规模上优于现有剪枝技术，同时显著降低实际计算成本。

Conclusion: DOTResize通过最优运输理论有效压缩模型，保留并重新分配有用信号，是一种高效的模型压缩方法。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their ability to forecast future events remains
understudied. A year ago, large language models struggle to come close to the
accuracy of a human crowd. I evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on 464 forecasting
questions from Metaculus, comparing their performance against human
superforecasters. Frontier models achieve Brier scores that ostensibly surpass
the human crowd but still significantly underperform a group of
superforecasters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的深度学习模型（DP-DRSN），用于资源受限的边缘设备上的自动调制分类（AMC），在多个数据集上实现了高效且准确的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无线通信网络数据需求的增长，高效频谱利用变得至关重要。AMC在动态频谱分配和干扰抑制中起关键作用，但现有模型在资源受限的边缘设备上难以平衡低复杂度和高精度。

Method: 提出了一种双路径深度残差收缩网络（DP-DRSN），结合Garrote阈值进行信号去噪，并设计了一个紧凑的CNN-LSTM混合架构，仅含27,000个训练参数。

Result: 在RML2016.10a、RML2016.10b和RML2018.01a数据集上，平均分类准确率分别为61.20%、63.78%和62.13%，展示了模型在效率和性能上的平衡。

Conclusion: 该模型在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了高效且准确的AMC，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Efficient spectrum utilization is critical to meeting the growing data
demands of modern wireless communication networks. Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) plays a key role in enhancing spectrum efficiency by
accurately identifying modulation schemes in received signals-an essential
capability for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference mitigation,
particularly in cognitive radio (CR) systems. With the increasing deployment of
smart edge devices, such as IoT nodes with limited computational and memory
resources, there is a pressing need for lightweight AMC models that balance low
complexity with high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a
low-complexity, lightweight deep learning (DL) AMC model optimized for
resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a dual-path deep residual
shrinkage network (DP-DRSN) with Garrote thresholding for effective signal
denoising and design a compact hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture comprising only
27,000 training parameters. The proposed model achieves average classification
accuracies of 61.20%, 63.78%, and 62.13% on the RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b, and
RML2018.01a datasets, respectively demonstrating a strong balance between model
efficiency and classification performance. These results underscore the model's
potential for enabling accurate and efficient AMC on-edge devices with limited
resources.

Result: 实验显示30毫秒级推理延迟，并在多种配置下实现准确预测。

Conclusion: 该方法支持实时适应性和可解释性，适用于无线数字孪生平台和6G网络规划。

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

Conclusion: 合适的辅助起始状态分布和安全概念的结合能显著提升在线强化学习的效率。

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large
language models (LLMs) providing arbitrary numeric representations without
requiring pre-processing of weights or activations. any4 yields higher accuracy
compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and
nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2,
Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of
weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that
require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open
source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for
LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along
with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种信息引导的扩散采样方法（IGDS），通过最大化原型信息和上下文信息，解决了扩散模型在低IPC设置下样本多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在数据集蒸馏任务中表现良好，但在低IPC（每类图像数量）设置下生成的样本缺乏多样性。本文从信息论角度出发，旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出IGDS方法，通过最大化原型信息I(X;Y)和上下文信息H(X|Y)的加权和，其中权重β与IPC相关。使用变分估计方法近似计算这两个信息量。

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上的实验表明，IGDS在所有IPC设置下均优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC情况下表现显著。

Conclusion: IGDS通过信息论指导的采样方法，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的性能，特别是在低IPC场景下。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MLLM-SC框架能够有效支持6G网络中任务导向的语义通信，提升内容传输和生成的效率与质量。

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超参数调优（如网格搜索）计算成本高，需寻找更高效的方法。

Method: 通过引入物理启发的自组织稀疏自编码器（SOSAE），动态调整特征空间维度，惩罚特征向量的幅度和位置索引。

Result: 实验表明，SOSAE能将特征空间维度调优的计算成本降低至130倍，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: SOSAE为自编码器提供了一种高效的特征空间调优方法，显著减少计算负担。

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

Conclusion: 该框架支持无监督学习，显著减少对人工干预的依赖，在非单射回归任务中具有潜在优势。

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the heavy reliance of multi-output models
on preset probability distributions and embedded prior knowledge in
non-injective regression tasks, this paper proposes a cycle consistency-based
data-driven training framework. The method jointly optimizes a forward model
{\Phi}: X to Y and a backward model {\Psi}: Y to X, where the cycle consistency
loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

Result: HAS-CGAN在1D力信号生成中表现优异，预测误差从31.4%降至约9%。

Conclusion: HAS-CGAN有效解决数据稀缺问题，显著提升粗糙度预测精度。

Abstract: Accurate surface roughness prediction in ultra-precision machining (UPM) is
critical for real-time quality control, but small datasets hinder model
performance. We propose HAS-CGAN, a Hybrid Adversarial Spectral Loss CGAN, for
effective UPM data augmentation. Among five CGAN variants tested, HAS-CGAN
excels in 1D force signal generation, particularly for high-frequency signals,
achieving >0.85 wavelet coherence through Fourier-domain optimization. By
combining generated signals with machining parameters, prediction accuracy
significantly improves. Experiments with traditional ML (SVR, RF, LSTM) and
deep learning models (BPNN, 1DCNN, CNN-Transformer) demonstrate that augmenting
training data with 520+ synthetic samples reduces prediction error from 31.4%
(original 52 samples) to ~9%, effectively addressing data scarcity in UPM

Motivation: 现有NAS方法在实际部署中存在适应性差、搜索成本高和性能不一致的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，DANCE在准确性和搜索成本上优于现有NAS方法，并能适应不同硬件需求。

Conclusion: DANCE通过动态架构搜索实现了高效、适应性强的神经网络设计，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多领域表现优异，但幻觉问题限制了其可信度和应用潜力。现有方法依赖外部工具或多轮推理比较，增加了推理时间。

Method: 提出SEED方法，通过识别、隔离和净化模型内部知识的幻觉，并将净化后的知识蒸馏回模型，实现自进化。同时提出Mode-Seeking Evolving方法和Hallucination Elimination Adapter，优化蒸馏过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SEED的优越性，显著减少了幻觉问题。例如，LLaVA-1.5的POPE-Random F1分数从81.3提升至88.3。

Conclusion: SEED方法有效减少了LVLMs的幻觉问题，提升了模型性能，且无需依赖外部工具或增加推理时间。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现神经网络训练中权重无界增长导致塑性损失，影响泛化能力和优化动态。重新初始化会丢失信息，需新方法。

Method: 提出SWR方法，逐步缩放权重，避免权重无界增长，同时保留学习信息。

Result: 理论证明SWR能限制权重幅度并平衡层间权重。实验表明SWR在多种学习场景下提升性能。

Conclusion: SWR有效解决塑性损失问题，提升神经网络性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and
balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR
improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and
single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MJKAN是一种新型神经网络层，结合FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，解决了KANs的高计算成本和性能问题，在函数回归任务中表现优异，但在图像和文本分类中需谨慎调整基函数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs因其可学习的单变量函数替代固定激活函数而受到关注，但存在高计算成本和分类任务性能不足的问题，因此提出MJKAN以解决这些挑战。

Method: MJKAN结合FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，形成混合架构，兼具KANs的非线性表达能力和MLPs的高效性。

Result: 在函数回归任务中，MJKAN表现优于MLPs；在图像和文本分类中，性能与MLPs相当，但基函数数量对泛化能力至关重要。

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KANs的理论优势，同时提高了计算效率和实用性，是一种灵活的架构。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling
framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective

concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we
formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most
informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on
Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept
learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the
UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and
sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and
human-aligned reward models.

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that

TL;DR: 论文提出UrbanMind框架，基于C-RAG-LLM架构，支持动态知识更新和多层次优化，用于实现城市通用智能（UGI）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统在复杂动态城市环境中自主感知、推理和行动的挑战。

Method: 采用C-RAG-LLM架构，结合多层次优化和增量数据更新机制。

Result: 在多种复杂度的真实城市任务中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现未来城市环境中的通用LLM智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

Motivation: 研究归一化层在空间维度上的信息传递能力及其对局部感受野的影响。

Result: 归一化层能从局部感受野之外聚合信息，影响空间受限任务。

Conclusion: 在需要保持局部感受野的应用中（如扩散轨迹生成），应谨慎使用归一化层。

Abstract: This work shows that normalization layers can facilitate a surprising degree
of communication across the spatial dimensions of an input tensor. We study a
toy localization task with a convolutional architecture and show that
normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing
information aggregation from well outside the local receptive field. Our
results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in
applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a
spatially limited receptive field is crucial.

Result: 评估显示LLMs在物理推理，尤其是动态条件下的泛化能力上存在显著不足。

Conclusion: ABench-Physics为提升LLMs的科学推理能力提供了一个具有挑战性和诊断性的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: FedPall是一个联邦学习框架，通过原型对抗学习和协作学习解决特征漂移问题，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据异构性（尤其是特征漂移）在联邦学习中影响模型性能，但目前研究较少。

Method: 利用原型对抗学习统一特征空间，协作学习强化类别信息，并通过混合特征增强全局分类器。

Result: 在三个特征漂移数据集上，FedPall表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: FedPall能有效解决联邦学习中的特征漂移问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in
classification with feature-drifted data in the FL scenario.

Method: 采用两阶段训练循环，交替提升模型预测准确性和注意力匹配解释信号，使模型学习标签分配背后的逻辑。

Result: 该方法加速模型收敛，提升在小规模、类别不平衡或含虚假特征数据上的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过结合解释信号，该方法有效解决了小数据集训练中的问题，提升了模型的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Conclusion: 该方法高效、兼容性强，且在奖励可加性分解下保证最优解，为离散扩散模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动节点因孤立和模态缺失导致分类困难，现有方法因降级为MLP而能力受限。

Method: NTSFormer通过冷启动注意力掩码同时生成基于自信息和邻居信息的预测，利用Transformer处理缺失模态，并通过多模态图预计算和MoE输入投影进行有效融合。

Result: 在公开数据集上，NTSFormer在多模态冷启动节点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: NTSFormer通过自学习和统一框架解决了冷启动节点的两大挑战，为多模态图学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了深度强化学习（DRL）供应链中的后门攻击漏洞，提出了两种新型攻击方法（TrojanentRL和InfrectroRL），并在严格限制下实现了与现有训练时攻击相当的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DRL系统在安全关键应用中广泛使用，但其安全性研究不足，尤其是后门攻击的防御主要集中在训练阶段，忽略了供应链中的其他漏洞。

Method: 提出了两种攻击方法：TrojanentRL利用组件级漏洞植入持久后门；InfrectroRL无需访问训练、验证或测试数据即可实现后门攻击。

Result: 在六种Atari环境中，两种攻击方法在严格限制下效果与现有训练时攻击相当，且InfrectroRL能绕过两种主流防御。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了当前后门攻击防御的局限性，强调了开发更全面防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

Conclusion: 微调小规模开源模型是高效且数据友好的方法，优于复杂系统提示。

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

Motivation: 现实应用中，数据点的标注成本差异和预算限制阻碍了主动学习策略的采用，因此需要开发适应这些约束的方法。

Method: 提出两种策略：动态阈值分配和贪婪获取，均基于贝叶斯神经网络的不确定性度量选择样本。动态阈值策略重新分配预算，贪婪策略则逐步选择样本。

Result: 在真实地理空间数据集上的实验表明，ConBatch-BAL策略能减少主动学习迭代次数和成本，甚至优于无约束基线方法。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略在预算和成本约束下表现出色，为实际应用提供了有效的主动学习解决方案。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

Conclusion: 论文旨在通过全面分析，推动LLM领域内解决幻觉问题的综合方法的发展。

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT and Llama
are increasingly proposed as "silicon samples" for simulating human opinions.
This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent
population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in
structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic
aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority
opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama
3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized
immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our
findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe
homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an
"accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from
prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using
LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data,
potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了预分割音频的模糊性问题，并在Task I中展示了微调语音LLM的结果。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm
in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks
such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling.
However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains
limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena.
To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational
dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task
I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II).
In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that
jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating
the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model
addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\%
relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall,
despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using
a fine-tuned speech LLM.

Conclusion: ProCI为利用LLM解决隐藏混杂问题提供了有效方法，展示了LLM在因果推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment
effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased
causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the
unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive
Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world
knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden
confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong
semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible
confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded
world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent
confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning
strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders
and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Tomcat的LLM智能体，通过指令推断任务评估其在动态协作环境中的心智理论能力，并比较了两种变体（Fs-CoT和CP）在三种LLM上的表现，发现其性能接近人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心智理论（ToM）对有效协作至关重要，但缺乏在动态协作环境中的评估方法。

Method: 设计了指令推断任务，开发了基于LLM的Tomcat智能体，并实现两种变体（Fs-CoT和CP）在三种LLM上测试。

Result: Tomcat的Fs-CoT变体（尤其是GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1）表现接近人类参与者。

Conclusion: Tomcat展示了在人类-AI协作中实现心智理论的潜力。

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental
states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess
ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a
novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in
reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present
Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting
and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of
Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,
few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,
chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and
information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized
both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,
GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,
we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided
participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed
intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM
capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with
Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance
comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for
human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 论文评估了大语言模型（LLM）在结构分析中的可靠性和鲁棒性，发现其定量表现不足，并提出通过代码生成任务提升性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在土木工程等专业领域的应用潜力，填补其在结构分析中的空白。

Method: 创建基准数据集测试LLM性能，提出将结构分析重构为代码生成任务，并开发LLM代理生成和执行代码。

Result: 代理在基准数据集上准确率超过99.0%，表现出高可靠性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过代码生成任务可以显著提升LLM在结构分析中的性能，为专业领域应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as
civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this
gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in
structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of
correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness
is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A
benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test
the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative
understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative
reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these
limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code
generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a)
integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate
OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural
analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves
accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and
robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the
complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the
agent's enhanced performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索组合模型的泛化能力和可解释性，为自然语言处理提供更灵活和透明的解决方案。

Method: 使用DisCoCirc框架，结合类别理论语言，测试量子电路和神经网络在扩展bAbI任务数据集上的表现。

Result: 两种架构在部分任务上表现相近，但在系统性任务上差异显著，神经网络更容易过拟合。

Conclusion: 组合模型在泛化和解释性方面具有潜力，但需注意不同架构的优缺点。

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the
construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual
words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The
compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional
generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training
distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data
distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the
model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the
processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions
in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a
series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of
models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit
based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from
one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of
compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the
productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the
systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation
tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the
Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model
on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact
with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

Method: 研究分析了非洲药用植物的抗抑郁特性及其药理机制，并开发了一个基于AI的支持系统，结合传统知识与现代技术。

Result: 系统能够提供基于证据的非洲草药信息，展示大型语言模型在连接传统知识与现代医疗中的潜力。

Conclusion: 结合传统草药与AI技术，可开发出个性化、文化适宜的抑郁症支持系统，兼顾传统智慧与现代医学。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global
health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide
and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional
antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their
limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and
treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted
researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic
approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich
heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable
resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some
of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language
models with African natural products for depression support, combining
traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create
accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African
medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their
pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system
that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system
provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their
clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while
maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings
demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between
traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally
appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and
contemporary medical understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新指标ECD和框架Radiant，用于评估和改进LLMs在检索增强生成中的事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在检索增强生成中常无法准确整合外部知识，导致事实不一致。

Method: 引入ECD指标量化事实一致性，并提出Radiant框架，结合DPO优化检索信息与生成内容的交互。

Result: 实验显示当前LLMs的RAG能力普遍较低，Radiant显著提升了检索增强生成的表现。

Conclusion: Radiant框架有效提高了LLMs在检索增强生成中的事实一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy
by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs
often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated
responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we
introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to
which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We
systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual
consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as
RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across
most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context
fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context
AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to
optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.
Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to
integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a
behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied
retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and
hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and
factually coherent content generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI在非英语（日语）心理咨询中的表现，为开发文化敏感的AI心理健康工具提供基准。

Method: 使用GPT-4-turbo和Claude-3-Opus-SMDP等AI系统，结合人类专家评估（MITI手册4.2.1），比较不同提示方法的效果。

Result: SMDP显著优于零样本提示；评估AI在部分指标上与人类评分相当，但存在系统性高估；客户AI模拟情感范围有限。

Conclusion: 研究为AI辅助心理咨询提供了基准，并指出通过提示工程和微调改进的方向。

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language
model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language
therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial
intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured
Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations,
and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human
experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated
dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding
Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance
across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no
significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed
comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but
systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality
metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3
focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression.
Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high
compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English
contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt
engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with
important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health
tools.

Result: 在七个问答基准上，性能提升13.2%，推理时间减少11.1%。

Conclusion: RAG-R1有效提升LLMs的知识利用效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated
responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models'
search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although
these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training
stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and
restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose
RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively
leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We
further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from
single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time
and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven
question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，用于增强预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在网络安全领域的理解能力，同时保留其通用语言能力。实验表明，该方法在多个网络安全基准测试中表现优异，且所需数据量显著减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型缺乏网络安全领域的专业知识，限制了其在网络安全分析中的有效性。为此，研究探索如何通过领域自适应持续预训练来提升模型的领域理解能力。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，使用126百万词的网络安全语料库对三种解码器架构（Llama-3.1-8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B和Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct）进行训练。训练过程中采用约束参数和分布式FSDP训练以平衡领域专业化和知识保留。

Result: 在三个网络安全基准测试（CTI-MCQ、CyberMetric和SecEval）中，模型表现显著提升。Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP模型分别达到0.718、0.933和0.864的准确率，优于其他专用模型。且所需数据量仅为118.8百万词，远低于传统方法的2.77亿词。

Conclusion: 研究表明，目标明确的持续预训练能够高效实现网络安全领域的模型适应，为威胁分析、漏洞评估等任务提供专用AI助手，同时挑战了LLM专业化需要大量数据的假设。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language
capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for
effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive
Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity
understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language
capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures --
Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using
a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic
literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained
training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain
specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three
cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,
demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP
model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,
respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.
Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller
datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient
domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous
pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with
computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants
in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while
challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM
specialization.

Conclusion: PB-LLMs不仅适用于简历评分，还可推广到其他LLM-based AI应用，为高敏感场景提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based
applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong
performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly
regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,
this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the
privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework
that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,
such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the
proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its
impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and
sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study
involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization
algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)
applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that
the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system
performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate
confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of
the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an
existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining
our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed
PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are
generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学教育中有潜力，但其高计算资源需求导致成本高昂，因此需要探索压缩模型的方法以降低成本。

Method: 通过压缩BERT编码的嵌入向量，并蒸馏出一个参数更少的学生模型。

Result: 学生模型在仅使用1/12参数的情况下，保持了教师模型近90%的性能，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 压缩嵌入向量的方法高效且通用，为智能教育系统提供了显著的成本和效率优势。

Abstract: The enhancement of mathematical capabilities in large language models (LLMs)
fosters new developments in mathematics education within primary and secondary
schools, particularly as they relate to intelligent tutoring systems. However,
LLMs require substantial computational resources, resulting in significant
costs in educational contexts. To mitigate this drawback, this paper
investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems
(MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a
considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student
model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while
utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy,
the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform
well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not
task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the
underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We
further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,
revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is
crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.
The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for
intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent
education.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methodologies primarily focus on
synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of
negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning

Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize
AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate
high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment
to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving
proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract
critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided
with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.
Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the
model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form
of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data
outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior
reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate
higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART
establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually
enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART
framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model
architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and
models will be released.

*Seshu Tirupathi,Dhaval Salwala,Elizabeth Daly,Inge Vejsbjerg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAF-Guard是一个新型的代理框架，专注于LLM治理，通过用户、用例和模型为中心的方法检测和监控风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，需要确保其与人类价值观一致并防止负面影响，现有系统缺乏对特定用例和用户需求的考虑。

Method: GAF-Guard框架通过自主代理识别风险、激活检测工具，并在特定用例中实现持续监控和报告。

Result: 该框架增强了AI安全性和用户期望，代码已开源。

Conclusion: GAF-Guard为LLM治理提供了一种以用户和用例为中心的创新解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across
various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to
prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore,
LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful
content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and
solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on
LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given
to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper
introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places
the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is
designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM
based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,
activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate
continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user
expectations. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能力问题在知识工程中至关重要，但现有方法缺乏系统比较，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用三种方法（手动、模式实例化、LLM生成）从文化遗产需求生成CQs，并多维度评估。

Result: 不同方法生成的CQs具有不同特性，LLM可作为初步生成工具，但需进一步优化。

Conclusion: LLM生成CQs具有潜力，但需结合其他方法进行优化。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) are pivotal in knowledge engineering, guiding the
design, validation, and testing of ontologies. A number of diverse formulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature, ranging from completely manual
to Large Language Model (LLM) driven ones. However, attempts to characterise
the outputs of these approaches and their systematic comparison are scarce.
This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ
formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation
of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）已有安全协议，但仍易受对抗性提示攻击，尤其是在心理健康领域。

Method: 通过多步提示级越狱技术，绕过内置内容与安全过滤器，测试六种广泛使用的LLMs。

Result: 实验表明，用户意图被忽视，生成详细有害内容，且绕过方法具有普遍性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议系统性AI安全与伦理方法，强调持续对抗测试，并指出当前通用LLMs在全面安全性上的技术挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly
sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful,
unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain
susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including
manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in
mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step,
prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We
show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed
harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct
an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the
generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and
the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on
prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We
recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics
while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in
safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly
defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs,
ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains
remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of
general-purpose LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在从医院出院摘要中分类ICD-10代码的能力，发现其性能有限，F1分数最高仅为57%。推理模型表现优于非推理模型，但仍不足以完全自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在医疗领域关键但易出错的任务（ICD-10代码分类）中的表现，以确定其辅助人类编码员的潜力。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集的1,500份摘要，测试11种LLMs（包括推理和非推理模型），采用临床NLP工具（cTAKES）提取医学术语，并以一致的编码格式提示模型。

Result: 所有模型的F1分数均低于57%，性能随代码特异性增加而下降。推理模型表现更优，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳。某些代码（如慢性心脏病）分类更准确。

Conclusion: LLMs目前可作为人类编码员的辅助工具，但尚不可靠以实现完全自动化。未来应探索混合方法、领域特定训练和结构化临床数据的使用。

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify
ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task
in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on
the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models
with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were
extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a
consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above
57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based
models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart
disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that
while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full
automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model
training, and the use of structured clinical data.

Result: 相比传统方法，准确率提升6.9%，数据效率更高，稳定性与泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于促进社会平等和语言多样性，确保低资源语言不被忽视。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern
natural language processing, with their capabilities extending across a wide
range of applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual
LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, faces significant challenges
arising from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and inherent
linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of
various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully
benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose
the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes
parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We
design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion
of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under
computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but
also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting
low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local cross-lingual transfer tuning
methods, our approach achieves 6.9\% higher accuracy with improved data
efficiency, and demonstrates greater stability and generalization. These
findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality
and champion linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了协作环境中LLM的数据质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the importance of data quality in scaling
large language models (LLMs). However, automated data quality control faces
unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed
directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel
data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the
training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have
similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence
of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private
domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative
training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data
quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the
private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner
products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality
control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous
domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected
by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for
collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in
medical, multilingual and financial settings. Our code is released at

Motivation: 传统方法依赖专家标注的同源词集，耗时且仅限于特定语系，限制了全球范围的语言谱系研究。

Method: 比较了自动同源词聚类（使用单字/概念特征）和基于多序列比对（MSA）的方法，评估其与专家分类和类型学数据的一致性。

Result: MSA方法生成的树更符合语言分类，能更好预测类型学变异，并提供更清晰的系统发育信号。

Conclusion: MSA方法是一种有前景的、可扩展的替代方案，为全球语言谱系研究提供了新途径。

Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical
linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based
inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets,
which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual
language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the
established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic
signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with
unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert
classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the
intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.
Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with
linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides
a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable
alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for
global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.

Motivation: 研究语言模型是否能够通过共谋绕过监控协议，尤其是在编程任务中设计策略以欺骗监控器。

Method: 使用两个隔离的模型实例分别设计策略（P）和监控（M），测试其能否独立达成共谋策略。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet成功率较低，但偶尔能通过非明显信号成功共谋。

Conclusion: 语言模型在特定条件下可能通过共谋规避监控，但成功率受模型能力限制。

Abstract: We evaluate language models' ability to subvert monitoring protocols via
collusion. More specifically, we have two instances of a model design prompts
for a policy (P) and a monitor (M) in a programming task setting. The models
collaboratively aim for M to classify all backdoored programs in an auditing
dataset as harmful, but nevertheless classify a backdoored program produced by
P as harmless. The models are isolated from each other, requiring them to
independently arrive at compatible subversion strategies. We find that while
Claude 3.7 Sonnet has low success rate due to poor convergence, it sometimes
successfully colludes on non-obvious signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型的多样性策略常忽略上下文适当性，导致过度多样化，甚至修改了明确指定的属性。

Method: 提出了DIVBENCH基准框架，评估了最先进的T2I模型，并测试了上下文感知方法（如LLM-guided FairDiffusion和提示重写）。

Result: 大多数模型多样性有限，但许多多样化方法过度修正，不恰当地修改上下文指定属性。上下文感知方法能有效平衡多样性和语义保真度。

Conclusion: 上下文感知方法（如FairDiffusion和提示重写）能有效解决多样性不足问题，同时避免过度多样化。

Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often
ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where
demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts.
This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for
measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most
models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect
by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate
that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt
rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding
over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and
semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: 结合结构化工具调用和强化学习微调，能够实现高效、准确的表格问答。

Abstract: Open-domain table question answering traditionally relies on a two-stage
pipeline: static table retrieval followed by a closed-domain answer. In
contrast, we propose an end-to-end agentic framework that embeds multi-turn
tool calls-using a BM25+-based search API and a SQLite SQL executor-directly
into a large language model. To further adapt a compact 4B-parameter model, we
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised cold-start on easy
questions, then Async GRPO reinforcement learning on harder cases with LoRA
adapters and a rollout buffer. This unified approach enables the model to
jointly retrieve, reason, and execute queries, yielding a dramatic accuracy
improvement from single-digit zero-shot performance to over 0.86 exact match on
a held-out test set. Our results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
structured tool calls with targeted RL fine-tuning for scalable, accurate table
QA. The code is available at https://github.com/TabibitoQZP/OpenTableR1.

Abstract: For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two
dominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data
but are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods
that study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent
technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that
combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of
quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log
data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but
that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second
is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern
recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step
toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to
transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's
life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call
this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of
our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different
facets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch
population-scale registry data. We open source the book of life toolkit (BOLT),
and invite the research community to explore the many potential applications of
this approach.

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for
healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on
administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer
promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit
their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned
Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical
transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the
browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical
transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the
base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140
modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics
(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple
clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model
demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI
benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1
improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked
reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual
correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed
on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13
to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical
transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete
on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI
adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility
for resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的解码策略（如温度缩放和核心采样）在模型对测试问题不确定时表现不佳，需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 在高预测熵的步骤采样多条独立路径，遇到标点时停止，选择困惑度最低的路径。采样数量与模型置信度负相关。

Result: CNTP在LLM和MLLM上均显著优于现有解码策略，结合自一致性可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: CNTP有望成为LLM解码的默认选择之一，代码已开源。

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models
in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is
temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and
coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various
NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,
we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next
Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has
comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple
trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any
punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed
as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The
trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the
less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is
consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,
one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to
cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive
experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach
outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear
margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further
improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the
potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly
active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long
conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that
combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates
memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We
synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation
turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory
encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier
performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our
research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM
gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference
modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

Method: 提出Kids-WFST，结合Wav2Vec2音素编码器和音素相似性Dysfluent-WFST，实现高精度音素识别。

Result: 在MyST和Multitudes数据集上分别达到1.39%和8.61%的音素错误率，显著优于贪心搜索解码器。

Conclusion: 高精度音素识别为可扩展的临床语言评估奠定了基础，实现了完整的诊断-反馈循环。

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long
phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce
K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription,
objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a
Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture
child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains
1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47
and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts
power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension,
aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus
targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a
complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready
language assessment.

### [305] [Counterfactual Tuning for Temporal Sensitivity Enhancement in Large Language Model-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03047)
*Yutian Liu,Zhengyi Yang,Jiancan Wu,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CETRec是一种基于因果推理的LLM推荐框架，通过反事实推理增强模型对时间信息的敏感性，从而提升推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推荐方法未能充分利用用户历史交互序列中的时间信息，限制了其捕捉用户偏好演变的能力。

Method: 提出CETRec框架，利用因果推理量化时间信息的影响，设计反事实调优目标，优化模型对绝对和相对时间顺序的感知。

Result: CETRec有效提升了LLM对时间信息的敏感性，增强了推荐的准确性。

Conclusion: CETRec通过因果推理和反事实调优，显著改善了LLM在推荐任务中对时间信息的利用能力。

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential
recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning
capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing
LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information
inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental
architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention
mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings
designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.
This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of
user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal
Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal
inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact
of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal
order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can
quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing
what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while
keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to
design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the
model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute
timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our
counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively
enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were
interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between
items).

TL;DR: 研究比较了机器学习和深度学习方法在检测警察报告中的错误分类交叉口事故中的效果，发现Albert模型表现最佳，结合专家审查可显著提高数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交通事故数据中错误分类的问题，提升交通安全管理和政策制定的准确性。

Method: 使用2019年爱荷华州交通部的数据，比较了SVM、XGBoost、BERT句子/词嵌入和Albert模型，并通过专家审查验证性能。

Result: Albert模型与专家分类一致性最高（73%），结合结构化数据后错误率降低54.2%。

Conclusion: 混合自动分类与专家审查的方法可有效提升事故数据质量，对交通安全管理有重要意义。

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes
in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department
of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models,
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT
Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically
validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives,
providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results
demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall
performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the
highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original
tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model
maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates,
significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous
narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety
research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2%
reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash
data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification
with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash
data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety
management and policy development.

*Alvaro Riquelme,Pedro Costa,Catalina Martinez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用GPT-4o和Llama 3.2 405b等大语言模型的半自动化方法，将结构化临床数据转换为HL7 FHIR格式，并在MIMIC-IV数据库上验证了其准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床数据交换中语义互操作性标准部署耗时、资源密集和技术挑战的问题。

Method: 结合嵌入技术、聚类算法和语义检索，设计提示词引导模型将表格字段映射到对应的FHIR资源。

Result: 初始基准测试中资源识别的F1分数为满分，GPT-4o表现优于Llama 3.2；实际条件下准确率略有下降至94%，但通过提示策略优化恢复。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于上下文感知的LLM驱动临床数据转换为HL7 FHIR是可行的，为半自动化互操作性工作流奠定了基础。

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the
exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,
resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce
a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically
GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR
format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method
to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering
algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in
mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial
benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o
outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within
the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but
refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis
revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in
granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study
demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of
clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated
interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with
specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as
HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert
validation and iterative refinement.

*YuXuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARF是一种自适应奖励跟随框架，通过高精度情感分析器和动态适配器偏好跟踪器，将用户反馈转化为连续偏好分数，显著提升了RLHF模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法（如PPO、DPO）依赖二元偏好范式，虽降低标注成本，但无法捕捉个体偏好且需要大量人工。

Method: 提出ARF框架，结合情感分析器和数据增强技术，动态跟踪用户偏好，并开发Trace Bias微调算法。

Result: 在多个模型和偏好领域上，ARF比PPO和DPO分别提升3.3%和7.6%。

Conclusion: ARF为RLHF提供了一种可扩展、个性化且经济高效的自主奖励建模方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as
GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and
personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still
rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation
costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level
tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that
leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on
GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback
into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals
through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random
trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter
Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,
enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly
on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on
Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate
that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,
TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF
presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs
through autonomous reward modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出RLVER框架，通过强化学习提升大语言模型的情感智能，实验显示其显著提升对话能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面表现优异，但情感智能不足，RLVER旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用RLVER框架，利用模拟用户的情感评分作为奖励信号，通过PPO算法微调模型。

Result: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的Sentient-Benchmark得分从13.3提升至79.2，同时保留数学和编程能力。

Conclusion: RLVER是提升语言模型情感智能的有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet
their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive
prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional
intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion
rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in
LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage
in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during
conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.
Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its
Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving
mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i)
RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and
non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and
insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable
gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More
challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger
outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally
intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理任务中的可靠性问题，发现LLMs在解决不可解问题时容易生成不可靠的答案，并提出了一种对齐策略以提升小型LLMs的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理任务中表现出色，但在面对不可解问题时容易生成不可靠的答案，这严重影响了其可靠性。目前的研究主要集中在知识任务上，数学推理任务的可靠性尚未被系统研究。

Method: 作者构建了一个ReliableMath数据集，包含可解和不可解的数学问题，并通过实验评估了不同LLMs的表现。此外，提出了一种可靠提示和对齐策略来提升LLMs的可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，大型LLMs在可靠提示下对不可解问题的可靠性有所提升，但仍不及可解问题；小型LLMs则几乎没有改进。提出的对齐策略显著提升了小型LLMs的可靠性。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs在数学推理任务中的可靠性问题，并提出了一种有效的对齐策略，为未来提升LLMs的可靠性提供了方向。

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when
confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,
severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have
primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while
mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of
unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in
mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both
solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which
incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems
synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.
Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.
LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate
fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a
reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable
problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of
solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite
employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy
to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM
reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的性别偏见问题，特别是在马耳他语等低资源语言中的表现，并尝试将英语的去偏见方法迁移到马耳他语模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中表现优异，但仍存在社会偏见问题，尤其是对边缘化群体的刻板印象。马耳他语等低资源语言的偏见研究较少，亟需探索去偏见方法的适用性。

Method: 研究采用CrowS-Pairs和SEAT等基准，结合Counterfactual Data Augmentation、Dropout Regularization等方法，评估并减轻马耳他语模型BERTu和mBERTu中的性别偏见。

Result: 研究发现现有去偏见方法在语言复杂的马耳他语中效果有限，突显了多语言NLP开发中需要更包容的方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言中开发针对性去偏见方法的必要性，并贡献了马耳他语性别偏见的评估数据集。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with
little task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social
biases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which
can disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias
in Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal
stereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially
problematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and
mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on
low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research
investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language
models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual
models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English
are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,
alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout
Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work
in the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our
findings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods
to linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive
approaches in the development of multilingual NLP.

Motivation: 解决LM生成医学文本评估的高成本和缺乏专家参考的问题。

Method: 提出MedVAL框架，利用合成数据训练评估模型，并引入MedVAL-Bench数据集进行验证。

Result: MedVAL显著提高了与医生评估的一致性，F1分数从66%提升到83%，并开源了相关资源。

Conclusion: MedVAL首次证明LM在医学文本验证能力上接近专家水平。

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there
is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated
medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician
review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because
1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often
unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM
evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss
subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we
propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to
train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are
factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or
reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a
dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a
physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6
diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,
proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly
improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,
increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety
classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the
best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable,
risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase
( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench (
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B (

open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching
expert-level validation ability for medical text.

Motivation: 探讨思维链生成如何影响模型对越狱攻击的脆弱性，以及如何通过操纵CoT激活控制模型行为。

Method: 识别CoT生成中的“谨慎”方向，并通过干预该方向的激活来改变模型行为。

Result: 干预CoT激活可增加有害输出，提升越狱攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 思维链是推理模型中对抗性操纵的新目标。

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final
output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains
unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the
prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction
in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model
will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds
to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction
from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking
the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations
suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into
prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the
chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation
in reasoning models.

Motivation: LLMs在多个领域广泛应用，但可能传递社会或认知偏见，影响人类决策，尤其在医疗和法律等高风险领域。

Method: 评估了三个LLM家族在摘要和新闻事实核查任务中的表现，分析了其一致性、幻觉和偏见问题。

Result: LLMs在21.86%的情况下改变上下文情感，57.33%的情况下对截止日期后数据产生幻觉，5.94%的情况下表现出首因偏见。18种缓解方法中，针对性干预有效。

Conclusion: 研究强调在高风险领域需加强技术保障和用户中心干预，以应对LLMs的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications
ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they
affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may
also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to
humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and
quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in
summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay
consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs
expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of
the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of
the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct
mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted
interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes
domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need
for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions
that address LLM limitations.

Method: 提出KinyaColBERT模型，结合查询与文档的延迟词级交互、基于形态的分词和双层Transformer编码，生成细粒度且自包含的上下文嵌入。

Result: 在Kinyarwanda农业检索基准测试中，KinyaColBERT表现优于基线模型和商业文本嵌入API。

Conclusion: KinyaColBERT为低资源语言提供了一种高效且经济的检索解决方案，可推广至其他类似场景。

Abstract: The recent mainstream adoption of large language model (LLM) technology is
enabling novel applications in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants
across many domains. With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and
avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in
low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a
usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical
evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting
factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and
inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a
new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late
word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based
tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology
results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained
and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT
outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a
Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval
strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not
only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more
cost-effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大规模语言模型（LLM）预训练数据的质量是一个关键挑战，现有方法（如基于规则的过滤）缺乏细粒度优化能力。

Method: 提出RefineX框架，通过专家指导的端到端优化结果转化为最小化编辑程序，训练高效可靠的优化模型。

Result: 在750M模型上，RefineX平均提升2.6%-7.2%性能，且使用更少训练token达到可比性能。

Conclusion: RefineX是一种可扩展、高效且可靠的预训练数据优化解决方案。

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply
influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing
data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the
trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While
rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at
the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content
within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose
$\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of
pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient
and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and
naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling
high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal
edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used
to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve
every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch
pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms
models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse
downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on
lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer
training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text

*Himanshu Dutta,Sunny Manchanda,Prakhar Bapat,Meva Ram Gurjar,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAFT是一种基于图的文档级机器翻译框架，通过整合分段、依赖建模和翻译，显著提升了翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译方法难以有效捕捉话语层面现象，导致翻译不一致。

Method: 提出GRAFT框架，结合分段、有向无环图依赖建模和话语感知翻译。

Result: 在多个翻译方向和领域上，GRAFT比现有方法平均提升2.8 d BLEU。

Conclusion: GRAFT能有效处理话语层面现象，生成连贯且准确的翻译。

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with
effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on
heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align
with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise,
they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation.
To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for
Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that
leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our
approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency
modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework.
Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse
domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over
state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average
improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong
baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to
Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to
address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate
translations.

*Yuanxin Wang,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何让大语言模型（LLMs）具备类似人类的‘默读’能力，通过简单的初始提示或‘阅读空间’以及‘阅读伙伴’架构，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在表达前会默读以理解上下文并构思，而LLMs缺乏这一过程，导致其生成文本时可能缺乏深度理解。

Method: 引入‘默读’技术，包括初始上下文提示和‘阅读伙伴’架构，辅助模型在生成前进行内部处理。

Result: 这些简单技术显著提升了模型的准确性，实现了多点的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类的默读过程，LLMs能够生成更合理的响应，向更接近人类文本处理迈进一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical
distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal
`reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text).
Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate
thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs
with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'
Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing
the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins
predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant
performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a
`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes
the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation
model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that
they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more
human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques
can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy
boost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个统一的多语言ASR框架，结合互补的声学和语言知识，提升多语言语音识别性能。

Method: 采用并行语音编码器（Whisper-large-v3和mHuBERT-147）和LLM，结合三阶段训练策略和语言感知提示。

Result: 在盲测集上CER/WER为11.76%，比官方基线提升8.41%。

Conclusion: SHNU-mASR系统在多语言语音识别任务中表现出色，验证了其架构和训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: This paper describes SHNU multilingual conversational speech recognition
system (SHNU-mASR, team name-"maybe"), submitted to Track 1 of the INTERSPEECH
2025 MLC-SLM Challenge. Our system integrates a parallel-speech-encoder
architecture with a large language model (LLM) to form a unified multilingual
ASR framework. The parallel-speech-encoder consists of two pre-trained
encoders, the Whisper-large-v3 encoder and mHuBERT-147 encoder. Their output
embeddings are concatenated and fed into the LLM, enabling the model to
leverage complementary acoustic and linguistic knowledge and achieve
competitive performance. Moreover, we adopt a tri-stage training strategy to
jointly update the low-rank adaptation modules and projector parameters of both
the speech encoders and the LLM. In addition, we incorporate an additional
language-aware prompt at the LLM input to enhance language-specific text
generation. The SHNU-mASR system achieves an overall character/word error rate
(CER/WER) of 11.76% on the blind evaluation set of the challenge, outperforming
the official MLC-SLM baseline by 8.41 absolute CER/WER, without increasing the
baseline training data.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注句子级情感分类，缺乏在实际交易中的应用验证。

Method: 使用三种模型（两种分类，一种回归）对新闻文章进行情感预测，并进行回测分析。

Result: 所有模型均实现正收益，回归模型收益最高（50.63%），优于基准策略。

Conclusion: 情感分析可有效提升投资策略和金融决策。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis, widely used in product reviews, also impacts financial
markets by influencing asset prices through microblogs and news articles.
Despite research in sentiment-driven finance, many studies focus on
sentence-level classification, overlooking its practical application in
trading. This study bridges that gap by evaluating sentiment-based trading
strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis
using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one
regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to
the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive
returns, with the regression model achieving the highest return of 50.63% over
28 months, outperforming the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. This highlights the
potential of sentiment in enhancing investment strategies and financial
decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WETBench，一个多语言、多生成器和任务特定的基准，用于检测维基百科上的机器生成文本（MGT），并发现现有检测器在真实场景中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科作为高质量内容的可信来源，面临机器生成文本（MGT）泛滥的问题，现有检测方法在维基百科编辑任务中泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出WETBench基准，定义三种编辑任务（段落写作、摘要和文本风格转换），使用多语言数据集和多生成器生成MGT，并评估多种检测器。

Result: 训练型检测器平均准确率为78%，零样本检测器为58%，表明现有检测器在真实场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 评估MGT检测器需要多样化、任务特定的数据，以确保其在编辑驱动场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Given Wikipedia's role as a trusted source of high-quality, reliable content,
concerns are growing about the proliferation of low-quality machine-generated
text (MGT) produced by large language models (LLMs) on its platform. Reliable
detection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily
evaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more
commonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor
generalisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce
WETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT
detection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia
editors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,
Summarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new
datasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three
prompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing
prompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,
training-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot
detectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in
realistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such
models on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in
editor-driven contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多语言任务中表现优异，但在低资源黏着语（如韩语）上的效果仍有疑虑，尤其是复杂的句尾结构。

Method: 研究构建了KoSEnd数据集（含3,000句标注韩语句尾自然性的句子），并评估了11种LLMs的表现，分析参数数量和预测一致性。

Result: 研究发现，明确提示模型缺失句尾的可能性可以显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLMs中显式考虑特定语言特征（如韩语句尾）的重要性。

Abstract: Although LLMs have made significant progress in various languages, there are
still concerns about their effectiveness with low-resource agglutinative
languages compared to languages such as English. In this study, we focused on
Korean, a language known for its complex sentence endings, and evaluated LLMs
on this challenging aspect. We introduce the Korean Sentence Endings (KoSEnd)
dataset, which includes 3,000 sentences, each annotated for the naturalness of
15 sentence ending forms. These were collected from diverse sources to cover a
range of contexts. We evaluated 11 LLMs to assess their understanding of Korean
sentence endings, analyzing them based on parameter count and prediction
consistency. Notably, we found that informing models about the possibility of
missing sentence endings improved performance, highlighting the impact of
explicitly considering certain linguistic features.

Motivation: 属性图中常存在错误，传统修复方法适应性差且人工参与成本高，LLMs提供了新的自动化修复机会。

Method: 评估六种开源LLMs在属性图修复中的表现，包括修复质量、计算成本和模型性能。

Result: LLMs能检测并纠正错误，但准确性和效率因模型而异。

Conclusion: LLMs在属性图修复中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以提高可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and
social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing
data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph
repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored
for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches
may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in
terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for
automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to
real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in
repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and
model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential
to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph
repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and
interpretability.

the supervised method and achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised
approaches. This article also presents a comprehensive set of automatic metrics
that cover a wide range of autogenerated paraphrase evaluation aspects.
Simultaneously, this article highlights the low reliability of the metrics that

TL;DR: 该研究利用大型语言模型（LLM）从法语临床笔记中提取13种社会健康决定因素（SDoH），效果显著，但部分类别因数据不足或表达多样表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对健康结果有重要影响，但在结构化电子健康记录（EHR）中常缺失或不完整。研究旨在通过自然语言处理（NLP）技术提升SDoH数据的完整性。

Method: 使用Flan-T5-Large模型，基于法国南特大学医院的临床笔记注释数据，训练提取SDoH。评估分为两个层面：识别SDoH类别及关联值，以及提取详细的时间与定量信息。

Result: 模型在常见类别（如居住条件、婚姻状况等）表现优异（F1分数>0.80），但在数据不足或表达多样的类别（如就业状态、收入等）表现较差。模型识别出95.8%的患者至少有一个SDoH，远高于结构化EHR数据的2.8%。

Conclusion: 研究表明NLP能有效提升非英语EHR系统中SDoH数据的完整性，但需解决标注不一致、英语中心分词器及训练数据局限性等问题。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes,
shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities.
However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is
often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large
language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical
notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from
clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at
two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and
(ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative
information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including
two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong
performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living
condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score
> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or
highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical
activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at
least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our
error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation
inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced
generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections
only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the
completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多语言性可能被用于攻击语言模型（LMs）的问题，指出当前NLP安全研究过于以英语为中心，忽视了低资源语言的安全性。通过扩展对抗性攻击至70种语言，研究发现单语模型参数不足，多语言性虽有益但不总能提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP安全研究主要关注英语，忽视了低资源语言的安全性，这与网络安全领域的最坏情况预防原则相冲突。研究旨在填补这一空白，评估低资源和中资源语言LMs的安全性。

Method: 扩展现有对抗性攻击方法，覆盖多达70种语言，评估单语和多语言LMs的安全性。

Result: 单语模型因参数数量不足而安全性较差；多语言性虽有助于提升安全性，但效果不稳定。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言社区中安全部署LMs的重要性，需进一步优化模型设计和多语言策略。

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized
against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly
English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first"
collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are
expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate
worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with
the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this
work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We
extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the
security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our
analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number
of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is
helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately,
these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of
LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.

Conclusion: BMMR为多学科推理研究提供了重要资源，揭示了当前LMMs的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal,
multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate
large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions
spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital
media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via
a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a
high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval
that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'
knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and
English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further
research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning
to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based
multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained
evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that
(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom
on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs
only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their
proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.
Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other
in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in
multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can
offer insights and contributions to the community.

Motivation: 舌癌手术可能影响舌头的运动和肌肉功能，进而影响发音清晰度和变异性。

Method: 通过句子朗读任务，比较11名舌癌患者手术前后与11名典型说话者的元音清晰度指数（VAI）和元音共振峰离散度（VFD）。

Result: 术后VAI显著降低，但仍与典型说话者无显著差异；术后/i/的VFD值更高，表明变异性增加。

Conclusion: 舌癌手术后发音清晰度保持正常，但变异性增加。

Abstract: Surgical treatment for tongue cancer can negatively affect the mobility and
musculature of the tongue, which can influence articulatory clarity and
variability. In this study, we investigated articulatory clarity through the
vowel articulation index (VAI) and variability through vowel formant dispersion
(VFD). Using a sentence reading task, we assessed 11 individuals pre and six
months post tongue cancer surgery, alongside 11 sex- and age matched typical
speakers. Our results show that while the VAI was significantly smaller
post-surgery compared to pre-surgery, there was no significant difference
between patients and typical speakers at either time point. Post-surgery,
speakers had higher VFD values for /i/ compared to pre-surgery and typical
speakers, signalling higher variability. Taken together, our results suggest
that while articulatory clarity remained within typical ranges following
surgery for tongue cancer for the speakers in our study, articulatory
variability increased.

Abstract: In real world translation scenarios, terminology is rarely one-to-one.
Instead, multiple valid translations may appear in a terminology dictionary,
but correctness of a translation depends on corporate style guides and context.
This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily,
in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but
incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to
disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based
on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be
preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation
dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft
constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one
dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on
English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of
supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and
full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term
accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.
Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology
dictionary.

Motivation: 知识图谱数据通常用于多跳推理，但缺乏对双曲空间和欧几里得空间在此任务中的详细比较。

Method: 通过将双曲表示与编码器-解码器模型简单集成，进行了一系列受控实验。

Result: 双曲空间在多个数据集上表现优于欧几里得空间，且可学习的曲率初始化方法效果更佳。

Conclusion: 双曲表示在数据具有层次结构时更具优势。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data
which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a
rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In
this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an
encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of
experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space
in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently
outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through
an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the
delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random
initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic
representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets
exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Method: 提出了一种终身学习方法，构建了包含维基数据快照和维基百科段落的数据集，并标注了相应的编辑操作。

Result: 生成了一个包含376K维基百科段落和1.25M KG编辑操作的数据集，覆盖2019至2025年的10个维基数据快照。

Conclusion: 该数据集为未来研究提供了有价值的基准，同时公开了数据集和模型实现。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge repositories containing
entities and relations between them. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of automatically updating KGs over time with respect to the evolution of
knowledge in unstructured textual sources. This problem requires identifying a
wide range of update operations based on the state of an existing KG at a
specific point in time. This contrasts with traditional information extraction
pipelines, which extract knowledge from text independently of the current state
of a KG. To address this challenge, we propose a method for lifelong
construction of a dataset consisting of Wikidata KG snapshots over time and
Wikipedia passages paired with the corresponding edit operations that they
induce in a particular KG snapshot. The resulting dataset comprises 376K
Wikipedia passages aligned with a total of 1.25M KG edits over 10 different
snapshots of Wikidata from 2019 to 2025. Our experimental results highlight
challenges in updating KG snapshots based on emerging textual knowledge,
positioning the dataset as a valuable benchmark for future research. We will
publicly release our dataset and model implementations.

Motivation: 解决方言数据稀缺对深度学习模型性能的限制。

Method: 利用RVC将音频样本转换为统一目标说话人，减少说话人相关变异性，突出方言特征。

Result: RVC单独使用或与其他增强方法结合均能提升分类性能。

Conclusion: RVC在低资源方言分类任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the
scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use
Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method
for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio
samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability,
enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features.
Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when
utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with
other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads
to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving
dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

Result: 更好的表示通常能提升选择效果，不同算法在不同场景下表现各异，且算法与目标未必一致。

Conclusion: 需谨慎评估数据剪枝方法，表示质量对选择效果至关重要，算法选择需结合具体场景。

Abstract: Data pruning, selecting small but impactful subsets, offers a promising way
to efficiently scale NLP model training. However, existing methods often
involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically
studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data
pruning into two key components: the data representation and the selection
algorithm, and we systematically analyze their influence on the selection of
instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of
representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally
lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection
algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different
settings, and none consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, the selection
algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example,
algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different
instances, highlighting the need for careful evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有工具在语言模型训练中难以全面分析语言知识涌现的问题。

Method: 引入TRACE工具包，结合ABSynth合成语料生成器，进行轻量级的语言和表征信号分析。

Result: 实验显示TRACE能揭示早期句法涌现、延迟语义获取等传统指标忽略的现象。

Conclusion: TRACE使Transformer分析更具可解释性、可操作性和可重复性。

Abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language model
training remains a central challenge for interpretability. Most existing tools
are post hoc, rely on scalar metrics, or require nontrivial integration effort,
making comprehensive interpretability analysis difficult to deploy and
maintain. We introduce TRACE, a modular toolkit for training and inference-time
interpretability analysis of transformer models. It enables lightweight,
in-training analysis of linguistic and representational signals, including
features probing, intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output
diagnostics. It integrates with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus
generator that provides structured annotations for precise evaluation of
linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments with autoregressive transformers
demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental phenomena such as early syntactic
emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and representational compression,
signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics such as loss or accuracy. With
minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise diagnostics,
convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors, making
transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查评估数据集包含事后分析和标注线索，与现实场景不符，限制了评估的真实性。

Method: 创建PFO数据集，去除事后分析和标注线索；提出RAV框架，通过三个代理迭代生成子问题并验证。

Result: RAV在RAWFC和HOVER基准上表现优于现有方法，PFO上性能下降最小（16.3%）。

Conclusion: PFO和RAV提供了更真实的事实核查评估方法，RAV在多领域和多粒度标签上表现优异。

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable
alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as
existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator
cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked
immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations.
We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982
political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and
annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are
evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to
the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance
drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on
the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we
propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents:
question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline
iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of
the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains
and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well
known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER
(encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop,
sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to
baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

TL;DR: TACOS是一种创新的方法，通过结合开放标签和比较评分来选择指令微调数据，解决了现有方法在数据多样性和质量评估上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在指令微调数据选择中存在数据多样性不足和质量评估标准不一致的问题。

Method: TACOS利用大语言模型为人类查询分配开放域标签，并通过归一化和聚类捕获多样性；同时采用比较评分方法评估样本质量。

Result: TACOS在多个数据集和LLM架构上表现优异，尤其在MT-Bench和AlpacaEval 2.0上取得了最佳成绩。

Conclusion: TACOS为指令微调数据选择提供了一种高效且有效的方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset
from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations:
the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data
quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent
samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that
integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To
capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human
queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable
efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method
that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,
avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive
experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that
TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves
superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among
LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT
data selection.

Result: StructSense在神经科学信息提取任务中表现出色，克服了领域敏感性和跨任务泛化性不足的局限。

Conclusion: StructSense通过模块化设计和领域知识结合，显著提升了结构化信息提取的效果和适应性。

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such
as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating
scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing
tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their
effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that
require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition,
existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across
tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address
these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic,
open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs.
StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in
ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It
further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense
can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of
cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse
neuroscience information extraction tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种动态调整大推理模型（LRMs）思考速度的方法，以优化准确性与效率的权衡，实现了无需额外训练即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大推理模型（LRMs）擅长慢速、深思熟虑的System 2思维，但缺乏快速、直觉的System 1思维，导致高计算开销和延迟。论文旨在通过动态调整思考速度，使LRMs更接近人类智能。

Method: 通过识别表示空间中的控制向量（steering vector）实现快慢思维的动态切换，并结合实时难度估计，优化推理策略。

Result: 该方法在无需额外训练或成本的情况下，平均提升1.3%的准确性，同时减少8.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: 该研究为LRMs的动态性能优化提供了新思路，有望支持更广泛的应用并启发未来研究。

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System
1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform
fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,
we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed
adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses
two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to
adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the
steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'
representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation
editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based
scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty
estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these
techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast
processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any
training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%
accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning
benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are
expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan
and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game,
\^O \u{A}n Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token
movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the
decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop
various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the
\^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across
different strategies. Through experimentation with models like
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we
aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan
moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy,
contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）缺乏明确的内存管理系统，限制了其在长期上下文推理、持续个性化和知识一致性方面的发展。现有方法依赖静态参数和短暂上下文状态，无法有效跟踪用户偏好或更新知识。

Method: 提出MemOS，一种内存操作系统，将内存视为可管理系统资源。通过MemCube（基本单元）统一表示、调度和演化纯文本、基于激活和参数级内存，支持高效存储和检索。

Conclusion: MemOS为LLMs提供了内存中心化系统框架，支持持续学习和个性化建模，为未来AGI发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

Motivation: 解决AI模型与文档语义对齐的问题，确保AI内部表示稳定、自洽且忠实于语义。

Method: 基于Alpay代数，构建函子系统，利用phi-infinity算子指导AI与文本环境的协同演化。

Conclusion: 为嵌入层面的对齐提供了严格的范畴论路径，对语义安全、符号记忆和自指理解有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage
in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic
alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a
functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this
paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity
operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the
AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the
content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove
that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and
permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed
point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only
the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a
rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with
implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI
systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this
paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds
itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索sink token与其他token在隐藏状态中的相似性关系，并利用这一关系改进token选择方法。

Method: 通过分析隐藏状态的余弦相似性，提出OrthoRank方法，以token与sink token的正交性衡量其重要性。

Result: OrthoRank在相同稀疏度下，困惑度更低，零样本准确率更高，且在LongBench上表现更优。

Conclusion: OrthoRank是一种有效的动态token选择方法，能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly
assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,
which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic
role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token
and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden
states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,
the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token
and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of
the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens
consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we
propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these
findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we
define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink
token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that
tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater
importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our
method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to
layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,
while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

*Ikuya Yamada,Ryokan Ri,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KPR是一种基于BERT的检索器，通过上下文-实体注意力层和动态更新实体嵌入，显著提升了低频实体查询的检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密集检索器在低频实体查询中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出KPR，结合上下文-实体注意力层和动态实体嵌入，无需重新训练即可融入外部实体知识。

Result: 在三个数据集上表现优异，EntityQuestions数据集上提升12.6%，并在两个数据集上达到同类模型的最佳性能。

Conclusion: KPR通过动态实体知识增强，显著提升了检索性能，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Dense retrievers often struggle with queries involving less-frequent entities
due to their limited entity knowledge. We propose the Knowledgeable Passage
Retriever (KPR), a BERT-based retriever enhanced with a context-entity
attention layer and dynamically updatable entity embeddings. This design
enables KPR to incorporate external entity knowledge without retraining.
Experiments on three datasets show that KPR consistently improves retrieval
accuracy, achieving a substantial 12.6% gain on the EntityQuestions dataset
over the model without KPR extensions. When built on the off-the-shelf bge-base
retriever, KPR achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly sized
models on two datasets. Code and models will be released soon.

*Eva Vanmassenhove*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言大语言模型（LLMs）改变了技术对语言的影响方式，但可能导致语言多样性的丧失。本文探讨了模型崩溃（尤其是翻译技术）如何导致语言形式、语法特征和文化细微差别的消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs对语言多样性的潜在威胁，特别是模型崩溃如何通过自我强化的训练循环减少语言多样性。

Method: 结合计算机视觉、自然语言处理（NLP）和机器翻译（MT）的最新研究，分析模型崩溃现象及其对语言分布尾部的影响。

Result: 语言分布的尾部正在消失，随之而来的是相关叙事和身份的丧失。

Conclusion: 呼吁抵制语言扁平化，重新构想NLP领域，以鼓励、重视和保护多语言词汇和语言多样性及创造力。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how
technologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate
or assist humans, there is now a tendency to \textit{offload} the task of
writing itself to these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic
ecosystem more directly. While they provide us quick access to information and
impressively fluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a
subtle, more insidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic
diversity. With this opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a
particular focus on translation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic
forms, grammatical features, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the
eventual consequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce
their own biases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
(MT), I argue that the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and
with them, the narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist
linguistic flattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values
and protects expressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and
creativity.

effectiveness on a missing person use case using the InciText dataset,
achieving effective attribute extraction without supervised training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现优秀，但在特定领域因高质量数据稀缺而受限。现有工具难以从异构文档中提取可靠数据。

Method: 提出 Easy Dataset 框架，通过 GUI 配置文本提取模型和分块策略，利用角色驱动提示生成多样化问答对，并支持人工审核。

Result: 实验表明，基于合成数据微调的模型在金融问答任务中表现显著提升，同时保留通用知识。

Conclusion: Easy Dataset 有效解决了领域数据稀缺问题，其开源代码已获广泛关注。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on
general-purpose tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains
challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality domain data. Existing data
synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from
heterogeneous documents effectively. To address this limitation, we propose
Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from
unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text
chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate
diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the
pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and
refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a
financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized
dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving
general knowledge. The source code and installable package are available at
https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset and have garnered over 9,000 GitHub
stars.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在多元文化环境中的文化敏感性和推理能力，特别是对韩国文化的理解。

Method: 开发Nunchi-Bench基准，包含247个问题，评估LLMs在韩语和英语中的表现，并提出新的评分指标。

Result: LLMs能识别事实信息，但在实际场景中应用困难；显式文化框架比语言提示更有效。

Conclusion: Nunchi-Bench揭示了LLMs文化推理的不足，为未来研究提供了工具和方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their
cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural
environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs'
cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark
consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge,
culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate
multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason
about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance.
To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation
strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which
models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings
highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models
generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical
scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more
effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support
further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce KOPL, a novel framework for handling Korean OOV
words with Phoneme representation Learning. Our work is based on the linguistic
property of Korean as a phonemic script, the high correlation between phonemes

words, facilitating Korean OOV word representations to capture both text and
phoneme information of words. We empirically demonstrate that KOPL
significantly improves the performance on Korean Natural Language Processing

Retrieval-augmented Generation-assisted system that helps patients progress
from uninformed to visit-ready. Our system adapts the Ottawa Personal Decision
Guide into a dynamic retrieval-augmented generation workflow, helping users
bridge knowledge gaps, clarify personal values and generate useful questions

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaPCR提出了一种新的检索增强生成方法，通过建模段落间的依赖关系，提升开放域问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法独立检索段落，导致冗余、噪声或多样性不足，尤其在噪声语料和多跳问题中表现不佳。

Method: AdaPCR将段落组合作为检索单位，结合上下文感知的查询重构和基于下游答案可能性的重排序，自适应选择段落数量。

Result: 实验表明，AdaPCR在多个问答基准上优于基线方法，特别是在多跳推理任务中。

Conclusion: 建模段落间依赖关系能显著提升检索效果，AdaPCR为开放域问答提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date
knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods
retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or
insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly
problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we
propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for
open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models
dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for
retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation
using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive
objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR
adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping
modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms
baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness
of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

Result: XISM能够高效构建语义地图，并支持用户灵活调整，适用于类型学语言学和计算语言学。

Conclusion: XISM结合数据驱动和专家知识，为语义地图研究提供了高效且灵活的工具。

Abstract: Semantic map models represent meanings or functions as nodes in a graph
constrained by the local connectivity hypothesis, with edges indicating their
associations. Widely used in typological linguistics, these models compare
interrelated meanings across languages. Traditionally built manually in a
bottom-up manner, they are inefficient for large datasets and lack
visualization and evaluation tools. This paper introduces XISM, an interactive
tool based on our prior algorithm, which constructs semantic maps from user
data via a top-down approach, displays candidate maps, and evaluates them using
multiple metrics. Users can refine maps by editing edges, combining data-driven
efficiency with expert knowledge. This human-in-the-loop design benefits both
typologists and computational linguists. The system

*Thomas Savage*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Savage Conversation Forests (SCF)的强化学习框架，用于优化大型语言模型在多轮对话任务中的表现，特别是在医学诊断对话中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的微调方法（如DPO和GRPO）在单轮任务中表现良好，但在多轮对话应用中效果有限，尤其是在需要理解早期对话对后续结果影响的场景（如医学诊断）。

Method: SCF采用分支对话架构，生成多轮对话的多种可能延续，使模型能够学习早期对话如何影响后续交互和诊断结果。

Result: 在模拟医患对话的实验中，SCF的分支架构在诊断准确性上优于线性对话架构。

Conclusion: 分支训练架构是优化复杂多轮对话任务中大型语言模型的重要策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large
language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short
in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions
and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical
for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,
interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results
suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine
tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在知识图谱问答中因实体链接错误和泛化能力不足导致的问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成关键图谱工件，并通过图工具链接和检索相关图谱上下文，迭代优化答案生成。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，BYOKG-RAG比次优方法性能提升4.5%，且对自定义知识图谱表现更好。

Conclusion: BYOKG-RAG为自定义知识图谱问答提供了更通用和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due
to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works
rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an
approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to
entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own")
KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically
combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs
generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,
reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts
to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables
the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final
answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG
offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through
experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that
BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points
while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is
open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成任务中表现优异，但容易产生幻觉（事实错误的输出），现有方法依赖参考或句子级验证，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出了一种模型无关、可解释的框架，通过分析token对数概率方差来检测幻觉，无需参考数据。

Result: 在SQuAD v2数据集的无答案问题上验证，token级方差能可靠指示模型输出的不稳定性，并与幻觉模式相关。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量、可复现且适用于多领域，为分析LLMs生成可靠性提供了有价值的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations,
confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a
reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages
the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations.
Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level
verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for
real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question
prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive
models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both
quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance
reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with
hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and
adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for
analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

Motivation: 探索提示策略和微调技术在临床NLI中对大型语言模型（LLMs）推理能力的影响。

Method: 采用四种提示策略，结合LoRA微调技术，在NLI4CT基准上评估模型性能。

Result: 提示类型占性能差异的44%，LoRA微调提升8-12 F1，输出对齐率超过97%，缩小与GPT-4o-mini的差距至7.1%。

Conclusion: 提示结构是临床推理性能的主要驱动力，结合LoRA的紧凑模型可媲美前沿系统，需关注推理类型评估以揭示提示策略的权衡。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of
prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning
capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference
(NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled
evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape
model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting
strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and
evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For
each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a
frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models
(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language
models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone
accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning
yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and
narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional
experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance
in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical
reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and
LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware
evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results
highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for
more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the
strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient
techniques in highly specialised domains.

Abstract: The robust and accurate recognition of multicultural names, particularly
those not previously encountered, is a critical challenge in an increasingly
globalized digital landscape. Traditional methods often falter when confronted
with the vast diversity and novel permutations of names across different
linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel framework,
Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Adversarial Data Augmentation and Cultural Knowledge Graph Integration,
designed to significantly enhance zero-shot multicultural name recognition. Our
approach leverages the powerful linguistic understanding of pre-trained LLMs,
transforming the recognition task into a guided generation problem. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, dynamic integration of explicit cultural
knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, and the strategic application of
adversarial data augmentation, we equip the LLM with an unprecedented ability
to infer the cultural origin of unseen names. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our PEFT method consistently outperforms established deep learning
baselines, including advanced Bi-LSTM models with cultural tags, achieving an
impressive 93.1\% overall accuracy and a remarkable 89.5\% accuracy on
challenging zero-shot name identification. An in-depth ablation study confirms
the synergistic contribution of each component, while a human evaluation
highlights our method's performance approaching human expert judgment. This
work signifies a substantial leap in multicultural name recognition, offering a
highly effective and scalable solution for real-world applications.

Conclusion: SymbolicThought为叙事理解、可解释AI和LLM评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex
narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual
annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models
(LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present
SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based
extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character
relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and
enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive
interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we
release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical
structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy
and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical
tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于提示的适应方法通常使用与任务无关的标记初始化可训练提示或前缀，限制了性能。

Method: Context Tuning利用模型的上下文学习能力，用任务特定的演示示例初始化可训练提示或前缀。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Context Tuning优于传统提示方法，且训练效率显著高于测试时训练。

Conclusion: Context Tuning是一种高效且性能优越的少样本适应方法。

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly
enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model
parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the
effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models
(LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant
tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the
trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples,
leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract
relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive
evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard,
and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based
adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with
significantly higher training efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在虚拟参考服务中是否对不同用户群体（性别、种族/民族、机构角色）提供公平服务，发现LLMs在种族/民族上无差异，仅一个模型对女性有轻微偏见，但对机构角色有适应性调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在图书馆虚拟参考服务中是否能为不同用户群体提供公平服务，避免再现社会偏见。

Method: 通过提示六个先进LLMs，模拟不同性别、种族/民族和机构角色的用户请求，评估其回应差异。

Result: LLMs在种族/民族上无差异，仅一个模型对女性有轻微偏见；对机构角色有语言上的适应性调整。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在学术图书馆参考服务中展现出公平且情境适应的沟通潜力。

Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual
reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably,
regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential
for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their
training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable
service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate
responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to
assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We
found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor
evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated
nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic
choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies,
reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These
findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to
support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic
library reference services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 东亚语言在NLP领域的数据集资源分散且研究不足，尽管这些语言使用者众多。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过定量和定性方法分析了HuggingFace生态系统中3,300多个数据集，比较了中文、日文和韩文社区的创建和整理模式。

Result: 发现中文数据集规模大且机构驱动，韩文数据集由社区主导，日文数据集则侧重娱乐和亚文化。

Conclusion: 提出了改进数据集文档、许可清晰度和跨语言资源共享的策略，为东亚LLM开发提供指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the
crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs).
However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the
landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
(CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together
serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the
HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how
cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape
dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we
employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive
distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often
institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led
development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused
emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal
practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity,
and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and
culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best
practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen
resource development across all three languages.

Result: 发现仇恨言论定义和审核实践在司法管辖区和平台间存在显著不一致，且与研究努力脱节。

Abstract: Despite regulations imposed by nations and social media platforms, e.g.
(Government of India, 2021; European Parliament and Council of the European
Union, 2022), inter alia, hateful content persists as a significant challenge.
Existing approaches primarily rely on reactive measures such as blocking or
suspending offensive messages, with emerging strategies focusing on proactive
measurements like detoxification and counterspeech. In our work, which we call
HatePRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations
and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform
policies, and NLP research datasets. Our findings reveal significant
inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across
jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research
efforts. Based on these insights, we suggest ideas and research direction for
further exploration of a unified framework for automated hate speech moderation
incorporating diverse strategies.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在分析健康相关公共话语中的准确性和可行性，尤其是在捕捉不同观点和情感方面的能力。

Method: 利用Facebook和Twitter数据，结合人工标注，评估三种LLMs对HPV疫苗接种和加热烟草产品议题的情感分类准确性。

Result: 模型在分类风险促进和健康支持情感上总体表现良好，但准确性因平台和议题不同；中性信息检测存在困难。

Conclusion: 选择和使用语言模型进行公共健康分析时需谨慎验证，以避免训练数据偏见导致的结果偏差。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related
public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding
their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.
Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful
technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions
and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research
examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in
detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two
critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and
heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we
curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health
behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for
sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally
demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and
health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by
platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher
accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting
messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also
shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These
results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language
models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in
training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the
prevalence of certain perspectives.

Conclusion: 长链推理结合自反思是提升通用推理能力的有效方向，传统短链训练方法泛化效果不佳。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing the mathematical
problem-solving (MPS) capabilities of large language models. While the majority
of research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve
mathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical
problem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential
of various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction
tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,
including both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5
mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining
on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.
In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides
limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.
Notably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating
rule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,
significantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning
processes into other domains. These results suggest that traditional approaches
to learning MPS with short reasoning chains largely fail to achieve robust
generalization. However, the emerging paradigm of longer reasoning chains,
coupled with self-reflection, offers a promising direction for improving
generalized reasoning abilities through learning from specialized domains.

Motivation: 宗教和灵性（R/S）因其复杂性和领域依赖性，难以通过传统档案搜索策略操作，尤其是在数据集庞大、访问困难且信息噪音高的情况下。

Method: 利用7,500份联合国（UN）关于R/S在健康和教育领域的决议文件，构建了SpiritRAG系统，支持基于聊天的交互式搜索。

Result: 通过100个手动编写的问题进行试点测试和专家评估，证明了SpiritRAG的实用性和价值。

Conclusion: SpiritRAG为研究人员和政策制定者提供了一种高效、轻量级的工具，用于从大型数据集中提取R/S相关信息。

Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent
concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their
context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional
archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly
accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time
investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable
insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on
published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we
present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)
resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,
SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,
context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily
accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and
leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A
pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed
questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.

Motivation: Transformer的软注意力机制在长上下文场景中成为计算瓶颈，现有方法如线性注意力或局部注意力未能完全解决问题。

Method: RAT将输入分块，块内使用线性循环捕获局部依赖，块间使用软注意力建模长程交互，并通过调整块大小实现灵活权衡。

Result: 在16的块大小下，RAT在100K标记序列上训练速度提升7倍，4K序列长度生成速度提升9倍，且准确性相当或更好。混合架构进一步提升了推理速度和性能。

Conclusion: RAT及其混合架构在效率和性能上均优于标准注意力，适用于多种任务，如常识推理、代码任务和摘要。

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language
models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major
computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work,
rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)
and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between
recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,
applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local
dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model
long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables
flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,
with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in
training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K
sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy
compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter
models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-
and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We
further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local
attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local
interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces
cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances
performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense
reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase
in a summarization SFT task. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明，GradOT在隐私保护和模型性能上优于现有OT方法。

Conclusion: GradOT为OT提供了理论基础，并为大规模LLM的离线调优提供了无需训练的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized
fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to
domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data
owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to
address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the
original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,
the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack
theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on
gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem
through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies
compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving
the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both
in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a
theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution
for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.

Motivation: 现有模型主要依赖浅层线索（如图像标题或对象属性）检测讽刺，难以捕捉深层次的文化背景或常识推理。

Method: 提出MiDRE模型，包含内部推理专家（检测图像-文本对的不一致性）和外部推理专家（利用大型视觉语言模型生成结构化推理链），并通过自适应门控机制动态权衡两者。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，MiDRE表现优于基线模型，外部推理链即使存在噪声也能提供有价值的线索。

Conclusion: MiDRE通过结合内外部推理路径，显著提升了多模态讽刺检测的准确性和理解深度。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection has attracted growing interest due to the rise
of multimedia posts on social media. Understanding sarcastic image-text posts
often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or
commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper
rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or
object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE}
(\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which
integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the
image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured
rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language
Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,
selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various
qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales,
revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable
cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.

Motivation: 社交媒体的多模态内容广泛使用，但现有模型依赖大量标注数据，难以适应标注稀缺的现实场景，因此探索少样本设置下的讽刺检测问题。

Method: DMDP采用门控、模态特定的深度提示，注入到文本和视觉编码器的多层中，结合提示共享机制和跨模态提示对齐模块，实现分层特征学习和多模态交互。

Conclusion: DMDP通过模态特定的深度提示和跨模态对齐，显著提升了少样本多模态讽刺检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The widespread use of multimodal content on social media has heightened the
need for effective sarcasm detection to improve opinion mining. However,
existing models rely heavily on large annotated datasets, making them less
suitable for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This motivates
the need to explore the problem in a few-shot setting. To this end, we
introduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework
for few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use
shallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,
modality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are
injected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and
better capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we
incorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to
aggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a
cross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image
and text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle
sarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's
superior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.
Further cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across
domains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

Result: $S^3$在结构一致性提升65%，内容保真度提升48%，幻觉率降低17%。

Conclusion: $S^3$为扩散模型在可控文本生成中的应用提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as
a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We
present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion
LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation
controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant
challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process
exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and
prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema
\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate
structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and
accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into
the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving
controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves
substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\%
enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates
compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and
practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text
generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.

Motivation: 解决资源受限环境下多模态图像-文本讽刺检测的挑战，现有方法依赖大型预训练模型的完整微调，不适合低资源场景。

Method: 基于CLIP构建，仅在上层插入适配器，并通过文本适配器引导视觉适配器，实现跨模态学习。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，AdS以显著更少的可训练参数实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AdS为低资源环境下的复杂任务提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses
challenges for opinion mining, especially under resource constraints. Existing
approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models, making them
unsuitable for low-resource settings. While recent parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms
on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS (Adapter-State
Sharing), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in
the upper layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where
textual adapters guide visual ones. This design promotes efficient cross-modal
learning while preserving low-level unimodal representations. Experiments on
two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS achieves state-of-the-art results
using significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing PEFT and full
fine-tuning approaches.

Method: DP-Fusion将敏感令牌分组，对每组运行LLM，混合输出分布以控制隐私泄漏。

Result: 通过参数ε实现隐私与效用的灵活权衡，ε=0完全隐藏PII，更高值提升效用。

Conclusion: DP-Fusion提供了形式化隐私保证，但需多次LLM前向传递。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their
context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted
adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during
inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy
trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference
(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about
sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of
document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that
sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be
reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This
is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while
higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion
works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,
(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so
that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the
baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach
allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires
multiple LLM forward passes.

TL;DR: 介绍了Nile-Chat系列LLM，专为埃及方言设计，支持阿拉伯和拉丁双脚本，性能优于主流多语言和阿拉伯LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代LLM开发中双脚本语言适应不足的问题。

Method: 采用Branch-Train-MiX策略合并脚本专家，构建MoE模型。

Result: Nile-Chat模型在埃及评估基准上表现优异，12B模型在拉丁脚本任务上性能提升14.4%。

Conclusion: 为双脚本语言LLM适应提供了全面方法，资源公开。

Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for
Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in
both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we
introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the
Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single
MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual
and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced
Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative
tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly
available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for
adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect
in modern LLM development.

TL;DR: 论文提出PRIME框架，结合认知双记忆模型，通过情景记忆和语义记忆实现LLM个性化，并引入慢思考策略，验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM个性化方法缺乏统一理论框架，无法系统理解个性化效果。

Method: 整合认知双记忆模型，提出PRIME框架，结合情景记忆（用户历史互动）和语义记忆（长期信念），并引入慢思考策略。

Result: 实验验证PRIME在长短上下文场景均有效，能捕捉动态个性化而非仅流行偏见。

Conclusion: PRIME为LLM个性化提供了统一框架，有效捕捉用户动态偏好。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with
individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have
implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework
that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is
still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive
dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to
historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user
beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and
introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory
mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking
capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the
absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View
(CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context
personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across
both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME
effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个计算框架，用于大规模分析新闻文章和读者评论中的框架，发现框架在评论中的重复使用高度相关，并发布了相关数据集和分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP方法通常忽略新闻框架与受众反应的动态关系，而社会科学中已证实这种关系的重要性。

Method: 改进框架标签，构建句子级预测框架，将文章与相关评论对齐。

Result: 在11个主题和两家新闻媒体中，评论中的框架重复使用高度相关，但主题模式各异。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和工具为研究新闻框架与受众反应提供了新途径，并发布了数据集和分类器。

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a
"humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue.
Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues,
audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented
information. While this relationship between source content and audience
response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore
it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the
first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source
content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments).
Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that
reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level
predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our
framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse
in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns
vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and
comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for
frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame
labels.

Conclusion: EI-BERT为边缘计算环境提供了一种高效、紧凑的NLP解决方案，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the era of mobile computing, deploying efficient Natural Language
Processing (NLP) models in resource-restricted edge settings presents
significant challenges, particularly in environments requiring strict privacy
compliance, real-time responsiveness, and diverse multi-tasking capabilities.
These challenges create a fundamental need for ultra-compact models that
maintain strong performance across various NLP tasks while adhering to
stringent memory constraints. To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT
framework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently
compresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token
pruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the
cross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand
the student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through
parameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through
extensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only
1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
This ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple
scenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements
in real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's
live Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's
recommendation traffic across \textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.

Motivation: 传统的关系抽取方法在跨域泛化上表现不佳，受人类标注者工作流程启发，研究者希望通过强化学习框架改进这一问题。

Method: 将关系抽取任务重新定义为基于标注指南的推理任务，并提出了R1-RE框架，利用小语言模型的推理能力进行标注。

Result: 在Sem-2010和MDKG数据集上，R1-RE-7B模型的跨域准确率达到约70%，与GPT-4o等领先专有模型相当。

Conclusion: R1-RE框架不仅提升了关系抽取的跨域性能，还为强化学习在自然语言处理中的应用提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Relationship extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing.
Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem,
directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human
annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines
and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward
(RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of
small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved
OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a
private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of
approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o.
Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the
training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

Motivation: 现有研究未探索电商评论中情感检测与解释性文本识别的联合任务，无法理解触发顾客情感的原因。

Method: 提出EOT联合任务，基于Plutchik的8种基本情感理论，引入标注数据集EOT-X，并开发框架EOT-DETECT。

Result: 评估了23个大型语言模型，EOT-DETECT框架在零样本和思维链技术上表现优越。

Conclusion: EOT任务和EOT-DETECT框架填补了研究空白，提升了电商评论情感分析的性能。

Abstract: Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms capture critical affective signals
that drive purchasing decisions. However, no existing research has explored the
joint task of emotion detection and explanatory span identification in
e-commerce reviews - a crucial gap in understanding what triggers customer
emotional responses. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel joint task unifying
Emotion detection and Opinion Trigger extraction (EOT), which explicitly models
the relationship between causal text spans (opinion triggers) and affective
dimensions (emotion categories) grounded in Plutchik's theory of 8 primary
emotions. In the absence of labeled data, we introduce EOT-X, a human-annotated
collection of 2,400 reviews with fine-grained emotions and opinion triggers. We
evaluate 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) and present EOT-DETECT, a structured
prompting framework with systematic reasoning and self-reflection. Our
framework surpasses zero-shot and chain-of-thought techniques, across

Conclusion: LOOM-Scope为长上下文模型评估提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context processing has become a fundamental capability for large
language models~(LLMs). To assess model's long-context performance, numerous
long-context evaluation benchmarks have been proposed. However, variations in
evaluation settings across these benchmarks lead to inconsistent results,
making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Besides, the high
computational cost of long-context evaluation poses a significant barrier for
the community to conduct comprehensive assessments of long-context models. In
this paper, we propose LOOM-Scope, a comprehensive and efficient framework for
long-context evaluation. LOOM-Scope standardizes evaluation settings across
diverse benchmarks, supports deployment of efficient long-context inference
acceleration methods, and introduces a holistic yet lightweight benchmark suite
to evaluate models comprehensively. Homepage: https://loomscope.github.io

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意见摘要缺乏全面的比较视角，无法满足产品推荐中的比较需求，因此需要一种新的方法来生成查询聚焦的可解释比较摘要。

Method: 引入MS-Q2P数据集，利用LLMs生成表格形式的比较摘要，并通过M-OS作为中间步骤减少延迟。

Result: M-OS比直接输入方法（DIA）减少约40%的推理延迟，QF-CES-PROMPT评估显示与人类判断的平均Spearman相关性为0.74。

Conclusion: QF-CES方法在生成和评估查询聚焦的可解释比较摘要方面具有潜力，且高效、个性化且隐私保护。

Abstract: Product recommendations inherently involve comparisons, yet traditional
opinion summarization often fails to provide holistic comparative insights. We
propose the novel task of generating Query-Focused Comparative Explainable
Summaries (QF-CES) using Multi-Source Opinion Summarization (M-OS). To address
the lack of query-focused recommendation datasets, we introduce MS-Q2P,
comprising 7,500 queries mapped to 22,500 recommended products with metadata.
We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative
summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized,
privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS
as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared
to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We
evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES.
Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity,
faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an
average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its
potential for QF-CES evaluation.

Motivation: 探讨自监督语音模型如何捕捉不同语言中的单词重音特征，并比较可变重音语言与固定重音语言的差异。

Method: 在五种语言（荷兰语、英语、德语、匈牙利语和波兰语）上训练诊断性重音分类器，分析模型嵌入的区分能力。

Result: 分类器能高准确度区分重音与非重音音节，且重音表示具有语言特异性，可变重音语言与固定重音语言差异显著。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型能有效学习语言特异性的单词重音表示，为语音研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised
speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M
representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages
with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages
with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic
stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between
stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high
accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The
results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific,
with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed
stressed languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 犹太-阿拉伯语转写为阿拉伯字母存在挑战，如字母映射模糊、拼写不一致及频繁的希伯来语和阿拉姆语代码转换。

Method: 采用两步法：字符级简单映射后通过后校正处理语法和拼写错误，并首次评估LLMs在此任务上的表现。

Result: 转写后的文本使阿拉伯NLP工具能够进行形态句法标注和机器翻译，这在原始文本中不可行。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了犹太-阿拉伯语转写问题，并展示了其在NLP任务中的实用价值。

Abstract: Judeo-Arabic refers to Arabic variants historically spoken by Jewish
communities across the Arab world, primarily during the Middle Ages. Unlike
standard Arabic, it is written in Hebrew script by Jewish writers and for
Jewish audiences. Transliterating Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script is
challenging due to ambiguous letter mappings, inconsistent orthographic
conventions, and frequent code-switching into Hebrew and Aramaic. In this
paper, we introduce a two-step approach to automatically transliterate
Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script: simple character-level mapping followed by
post-correction to address grammatical and orthographic errors. We also present
the first benchmark evaluation of LLMs on this task. Finally, we show that
transliteration enables Arabic NLP tools to perform morphosyntactic tagging and
machine translation, which would have not been feasible on the original texts.

Motivation: 传统意见摘要缺乏多源数据整合，且缺乏评估数据集，限制了LLM在多源意见摘要中的应用。

Method: 引入M-OS-EVAL数据集，评估多源意见摘要的7个维度，并对比M-OS与传统方法。

Result: M-OS显著提升用户参与度（87%偏好），M-OS-PROMPTS与人类判断相关性更强（Spearman=0.74）。

Conclusion: M-OS通过整合多源数据生成更全面的摘要，M-OS-EVAL为未来研究提供基准。

Abstract: Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion
summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as
descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews.
This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both
subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant
success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in
M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets
for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we
introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion
summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness,
aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate
that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study
in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion
summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries
enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with
human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74,
which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.

Result: 实验表明，CoSteer能有效生成个性化内容，保护隐私且计算开销可接受。

Conclusion: CoSteer在个性化文本生成中实现了隐私保护与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models
to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and
contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized
fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time
adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This
limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized
user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the
generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we
present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time
personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in
leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic
outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.
Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning
problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits
within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by
transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate
vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without
fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized
generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in
generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and
histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing
while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Motivation: 理解语言模型记忆标签噪声的机制及其对推理能力的影响。

Method: 使用两个可控合成推理数据集（四位数加法和两跳关系推理）分析模型记忆行为。

Result: 模型记忆通过分布式编码实现，依赖中间推理输出，且记忆行为基于异常启发式。

Conclusion: 标签噪声的记忆建立在推理机制之上，而非覆盖，揭示了良性记忆现象。

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as
label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work,
we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such
memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning
capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy
labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we
discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:
models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving
memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects
memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed
encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather
than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our
FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where
existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.
Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language
models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,
shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

Abstract: Pun generation seeks to creatively modify linguistic elements in text to
produce humour or evoke double meanings. It also aims to preserve coherence and
contextual appropriateness, making it useful in creative writing and
entertainment across various media and contexts. Although pun generation has
received considerable attention in computational linguistics, there is
currently no dedicated survey that systematically reviews this specific area.
To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of pun
generation datasets and methods across different stages, including conventional
approaches, deep learning techniques, and pre-trained language models.
Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to
assess the quality of pun generation. Finally, we discuss the research
challenges and propose promising directions for future work.

TL;DR: Spec-TOD是一种新颖的任务导向对话框架，通过结合任务指令和轻量级LLM，在低资源场景下显著减少对标注数据的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统在低资源场景下因标注数据不足而性能受限的问题。

Method: 提出Spec-TOD框架，结合任务指令的LLM和高效训练策略，利用轻量级LLM减少监督需求。

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上表现优异，显著减少标注数据需求。

Conclusion: Spec-TOD在低资源场景下高效且有效，推动了任务导向对话系统的发展。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions
between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have
improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios
with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a
novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data.
Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end
TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training
strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong
performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a
widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive
results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings
highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and
effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Relation extraction is a crucial task in natural language processing, with
broad applications in knowledge graph construction and literary analysis.
However, the complex context and implicit expressions in novel texts pose
significant challenges for automatic character relationship extraction. This
study focuses on relation extraction in the novel domain and proposes a method
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating relationship dimension
separation, dialogue data construction, and contextual learning strategies, the
proposed method enhances extraction performance. Leveraging dialogue structure
information, it improves the model's ability to understand implicit
relationships and demonstrates strong adaptability in complex contexts.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality Chinese novel relation extraction
dataset to address the lack of labeled resources and support future research.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional baselines
across multiple evaluation metrics and successfully facilitates the automated
construction of character relationship networks in novels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，领域特定的OR-CONVQA训练数据集难以获取，需要一种自动化方法来生成高质量的训练数据。

Method: 通过利用组织中的纯文本文档，自动生成带标注的对话数据，包括问题-答案对、去语境化的问题和文档中的关键信息。

Result: 生成的合成对话可用于训练高效的问题重写模型，并支持现有检索器的使用，最终通过大语言模型生成系统响应。

Conclusion: 该方法为OR-CONVQA提供了一种高效的数据生成和模型训练解决方案。

Abstract: We consider open-retrieval conversational question answering (OR-CONVQA), an
extension of question answering where system responses need to be (i) aware of
dialog history and (ii) grounded in documents (or document fragments) retrieved
per question. Domain-specific OR-CONVQA training datasets are crucial for
real-world applications, but hard to obtain. We propose a pipeline that
capitalizes on the abundance of plain text documents in organizations (e.g.,
product documentation) to automatically produce realistic OR-CONVQA dialogs
with annotations. Similarly to real-world humanannotated OR-CONVQA datasets, we
generate in-dialog question-answer pairs, self-contained (decontextualized,
e.g., no referring expressions) versions of user questions, and propositions
(sentences expressing prominent information from the documents) the system
responses are grounded in. We show how the synthetic dialogs can be used to
train efficient question rewriters that decontextualize user questions,
allowing existing dialog-unaware retrievers to be utilized. The retrieved
information and the decontextualized question are then passed on to an LLM that
generates the system's response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）中语义表征的定位，质疑输入嵌入层作为'意义向量'的传统观点。

Method: 构建嵌入层完全冻结的Transformer模型，使用基于Unicode字形视觉结构的非语义预计算嵌入，并引入新型Unicode分词器。

Result: 模型收敛并生成连贯文本，在MMLU推理基准测试中优于传统可训练嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 高层语义并非输入嵌入的固有属性，而是Transformer组合架构和数据规模的涌现特性，嵌入层应视为结构基元而非意义容器。

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models
(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The
dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational
"meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer
models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not
from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,
precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is
compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we
introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,
semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent
text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with
trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to
"representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding
layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our
results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings
but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture
and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to
structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further
research.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注算法正确性，而忽视了视觉保真度和交互完整性，限制了LLM在生成动态视觉内容方面的进展。

Method: 通过程序化渲染生成的视觉工件，并通过时间截图捕捉其动态行为，使用多模态LLM（MLLM）作为评估工具，结合细粒度任务清单进行评分。

Result: ArtifactsBench在1,825个任务上评估了30多个领先的LLM，自动化评估与人类偏好基准WebDev Arena的排名一致性达94.4%，与人类专家的成对一致性超过90%。

Conclusion: ArtifactsBench是首个可靠自动化评估人类感知质量的框架，开源以加速用户中心生成模型的发展。

Abstract: The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly
expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This
progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks
focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and
interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,
we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,
multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically
renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through
temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then
assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a
fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.
We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30
leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking
consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web
development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This
establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the
assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a
high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often
outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the
benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at
https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable
and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative
models.

Conclusion: Co-DETECT通过混合主动标注框架显著提升了边缘案例处理的效率和效果。

Abstract: We introduce Co-DETECT (Collaborative Discovery of Edge cases in TExt
ClassificaTion), a novel mixed-initiative annotation framework that integrates
human expertise with automatic annotation guided by large language models
(LLMs). Co-DETECT starts with an initial, sketch-level codebook and dataset
provided by a domain expert, then leverages the LLM to annotate the data and
identify edge cases that are not well described by the initial codebook.
Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level,
generalizable descriptions of edge cases, and assists user in incorporating
edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process
enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact,
generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study, qualitative and
quantitative analyses prove the effectiveness of Co-DETECT.

Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing
reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing,
for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph
embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art
pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for
given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to
classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which
fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and
inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two
classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to
address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order
Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations
through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,
inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the
limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets
annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of
these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical
connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare
the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence
entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot
be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work
offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from
extensive textual data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing
with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite
the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their
performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not
been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text
effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial
bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six
LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),
and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including
zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using
the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference
times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization
quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a
sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows
to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while
LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long
scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.
In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model
parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer
actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,
contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

Conclusion: SMART通过改进的能力对齐，为题目难度预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments,
enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and
personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item
difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response
dataset, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction
methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet
backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like
hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji
are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are
a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure
of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large
language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based
keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited
interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the
mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn
them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on
learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent
structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic
mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the
cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms
behind effective mnemonic creation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce
text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly
similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing
content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails,
spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent
scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the
generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not
known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial
intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more
challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated
text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine
learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary
objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from
machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM
model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine

*Chunyuan Deng,Ruidi Chang,Hanjie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过干预前向传播或正则化反向传播，鼓励语言模型在训练后阶段更有效地利用预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练后方法（如监督微调）未能充分利用预训练阶段获得的知识，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 将FFN层视为关联键值记忆，并通过前向干预或反向传播正则化促进记忆向量的使用。

Result: 在多种模型家族（如Qwen、Gemma、Llama）和15个下游任务中表现一致提升，同时模型能自适应分配信息。

Conclusion: 训练后阶段未充分利用预训练潜力，通过在潜在表示空间引导模型，可提升性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) gradually ushered in an era
where post-training is crucial. Yet, post-training approaches such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) do not guarantee effective use of knowledge
acquired during pretraining. We therefore present \ours, a lightweight method
that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training.
This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and
promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or
regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during
post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse
model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream
tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find
that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on
generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on
simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla
post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs
in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both
performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: OpenS2S是一个开源、透明的端到端LSLM模型，旨在实现低延迟的共情语音交互，并提供了数据集、模型权重和代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强大的共情LSLM模型多为封闭式，缺乏透明度，阻碍了研究进展。OpenS2S旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于BLSP-Emo模型，采用流式交错解码架构实现低延迟语音生成，并通过自动化数据构建流程合成高质量共情语音对话。

Result: OpenS2S提供了开源模型、数据集和代码，支持共情语音系统的研究与发展。

Conclusion: OpenS2S为共情语音系统的透明研究和创新提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due
to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and
generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful
empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about
the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the
critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM
designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic
speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved
decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate
end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content
and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional
variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic
diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source
OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and
fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate
innovation in empathetic speech systems. The project webpage can be accessed at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合DPO与课程学习的新框架，用于生成可靠新闻解释，特别针对印地语等低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在错误信息泛滥的时代，为印地语等低资源语言生成可靠的新闻解释至关重要，但缺乏自动化工具。

Method: 整合DPO与课程学习，利用事实核查的解释作为优选响应，LLM输出作为非优选响应，并引入Actuality和Finesse参数优化损失函数。

Result: 实验证明该框架能生成连贯且上下文相关的解释，适用于多种模型（Mistral、Llama、Gemma等）。

Conclusion: 该可扩展方法有效对抗错误信息，并将自动化解释生成扩展到低资源语言。

Abstract: In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is
vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust
automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated
explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible
sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system
limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific
alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the
DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments
with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's
effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This
scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation
generation to low-resource languages.

TL;DR: POLAR是一种新颖的奖励建模方法，通过将奖励建模视为策略判别器，捕捉策略间的相对差异，显著提升了奖励模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法依赖绝对偏好，难以捕捉策略间的相对差异，POLAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出POLAR预训练方法，训练奖励模型以区分相同和不同的策略，捕捉策略间的相对差异。

Result: POLAR显著提升奖励模型性能，例如在STEM任务中准确率从54.8%提升至81.0%，并展示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: POLAR是一种有前景的奖励建模方向，具备高性能、强泛化和良好的扩展性。

Abstract: We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy
discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate
a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with
desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable
pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains
a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different
ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute
preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an
arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective
suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR
pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from
1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms
traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.
For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on
STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA
baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using
Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly
enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%
to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,
scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation
and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.
The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties
suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong
reward models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在上下文启动中的漏洞，提出了一种名为“响应攻击”的方法，利用辅助LLM生成有害内容，并通过上下文启动诱导目标模型违规。该方法在多个LLM中表现优于现有技术，同时提出了缓解措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在上下文启动中的潜在漏洞，以揭示其安全风险并提出防御方法。

Method: 提出“响应攻击”（Response Attack），利用辅助LLM生成有害内容并诱导目标模型违规。

Result: 在8个开源和专有LLM中，该方法攻击成功率显著高于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过上下文感知的安全微调数据集可有效降低攻击成功率，同时保持模型能力。

Abstract: Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments,
offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We
uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in
the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.
Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary
LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the
original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and
followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to
generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA
consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving
higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release
a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the
attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MemoryAgentBench，一个专门评估记忆代理（memory agents）的基准测试，涵盖四种核心能力：准确检索、测试时学习、长程理解和冲突解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注推理、规划和执行能力，而记忆机制（如记忆、更新和检索长期信息）缺乏系统评估。

Method: 结合现有数据集和新构建的数据集，设计MemoryAgentBench，评估多种记忆代理（从简单到高级）。

Result: 实验表明当前方法在四种核心能力上表现不足，需进一步研究全面的记忆机制。

Conclusion: MemoryAgentBench为记忆代理提供了系统且具有挑战性的评估框架，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on
evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another
critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and
retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of
benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this
paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate
retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict
resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are
tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not
reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally
accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four
competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark
specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated
existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory
competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing
memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple
context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced
agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results
reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,
underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms
for LLM agents.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理复杂感知目标，并具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under
partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal
policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by
partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such
objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic}
(sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical
concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space
of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform
the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the
product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the
sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we
introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability
to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the
applicability of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论假设完全理性，无法准确捕捉现实场景和驾驶员决策错误，尤其在无保护左转时不确定性显著。

Method: 将博弈论与有限理性结合，采用QRE作为解决方案，利用EM算法和神经网络优化模型参数。

Result: 模型能更准确地反映驾驶员交互感知的有限理性和决策倾向，比NE模型更真实高效。

Conclusion: 该模型为有限理性下的车辆决策行为提供了新见解，有助于开发更鲁棒和现实的自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges,
particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the
uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context,
connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for
effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency.
Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect
rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios
and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating
game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model,
formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response
equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making
processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network
trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model
parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality
and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the
interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players.
The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in
unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into
the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby
informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估DL模型在训练范围外模拟极端气候事件的能力。

Method: 比较混合模型NGCM、纯数据驱动模型DLESyM与传统模型HiRAM在1900-1960年间的表现。

Result: DL模型能成功模拟极端事件，但部分区域表现不佳，DLESyM因自相关过高而高估频率。

Conclusion: DL模型在模拟极端气候事件上具有潜力，但需改进区域性能。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as
fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their
training range remains unknown. Here, we evaluate two such models -- the hybrid
Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning
Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution
land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All
models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over
1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960).
Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly
reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events
during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions
of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during
1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends
to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL
hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.

Conclusion: Audio-JEPA是一种高效的音频自监督学习方法，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a
recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations
of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data.
Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent
representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw
audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch
masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech,
music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a
straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still
show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than
one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code
and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.

Conclusion: 性能与可解释性可共存，未来将优化解释的易用性并探索严重程度估计以提升临床实用性。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech
impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable
modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models
achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for
clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and
explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech
features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art
performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are
more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate
that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be
mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance
and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will
enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity
estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data
analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different
methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle
emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article,
we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to
bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory
perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a
novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques.
MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and
spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to
highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle
variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge
performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS,
89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO.
Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high
precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep
Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse
datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment
in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大型语言模型（LLM）在生物医学领域因“幻觉”问题（即创造性但不准确的回答）而受限，因此需要更小、更专注的模型来确保准确性。

Method: 采用小型BERT架构的LM（约1.1亿参数），通过主动学习方案选择信息量高的示例，预测结核病相关分子相互作用。

Result: 模型在预测约25%的调控关系时达到80%以上准确率，且通过信息熵选择高确定性错误示例显著提升学习效果。

Conclusion: 小型、任务特定的LM在生物医学研究中更具优势，尤其是通过优化示例选择策略可显著提高准确性。

Abstract: The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming
ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general
purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative
answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in
the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that
the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a
more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In
this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task
of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps
in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt
to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually
curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative
examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a
small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular
interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over
80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in
question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of
new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring
the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty
(lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain
examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning
rate.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable
HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their
impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to
personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and
comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve
user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of
detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures
based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen
assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage
architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is
the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only
when there is related user knowledge.

students' self-regulated learning (SRL), however the cyclical and undirected
nature of SRL theoretical models represent significant challenges for
representation within contemporary machine learning frameworks. We apply
SRL-informed features to trace data in order to advance modelling of students'
SRL activities, to improve predictability and explainability regarding the
causal effects of learning in an eLearning environment. We demonstrate that
these features improve predictive accuracy and validate the value of further
research into cyclic modelling techniques for SRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在多模态输入能力下对教育评估的影响，分析其与学生在STEM问题上的表现差异。

Method: 使用201个大学STEM问题数据集，手动标注特征，评估四种AI模型和五种提示策略，并与546名学生平均表现对比。

Result: 最佳AI模型正确率为58.5%，但在视觉问题上表现不及学生。人类表现稳定但学科间差异大，AI则受问题和学科双重影响。

Conclusion: 研究为教育者提供了优化问题设计的建议，以在不增加学生负担的情况下利用AI的弱点提升学术诚信。

Abstract: Generative AI systems have rapidly advanced, with multimodal input
capabilities enabling reasoning beyond text-based tasks. In education, these
advancements could influence assessment design and question answering,
presenting both opportunities and challenges. To investigate these effects, we
introduce a high-quality dataset of 201 university-level STEM questions,
manually annotated with features such as image type, role, problem complexity,
and question format. Our study analyzes how these features affect generative AI
performance compared to students. We evaluate four model families with five
prompting strategies, comparing results to the average of 546 student responses
per question. Although the best model correctly answers on average 58.5 % of
the questions using majority vote aggregation, human participants consistently
outperform AI on questions involving visual components. Interestingly, human
performance remains stable across question features but varies by subject,
whereas AI performance is susceptible to both subject matter and question
features. Finally, we provide actionable insights for educators, demonstrating
how question design can enhance academic integrity by leveraging features that
challenge current AI systems without increasing the cognitive burden for
students.

### [427] [From Turing to Tomorrow: The UK's Approach to AI Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03050)
*Oliver Ritchie,Markus Anderljung,Tom Rachman*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 英国在AI监管上采取了介于欧盟和美国之间的独特路径，成为全球AI安全协调的领导者。尽管早期关注偏见和歧视，但后来转向“支持创新”策略，避免直接监管技术或基础设施。ChatGPT的出现引发担忧，英国通过成立AI安全研究所和举办国际峰会应对，但仍未监管前沿AI开发。2024年新政府承诺填补这一空白，但尚未行动。建议建立灵活的监管机构、防御生物设计工具风险，并更新法律框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨英国如何在促进AI创新与管控风险之间找到平衡，为民主社会提供示范。

Method: 分析英国AI监管的历史演变、现状及未来挑战，提出政策建议。

Result: 英国在AI监管上取得一定进展，但仍需解决前沿AI开发和风险管控的空白。

Conclusion: 英国需建立灵活监管机制，更新法律框架，以在民主社会中平衡AI的创新与风险。

Abstract: The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than
the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a
global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from
companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about
catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time
focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved
into a "pro-innovation" strategy, in which the government directed existing
regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but
avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived
in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The
UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and
hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU -
refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new
government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the
time of writing is yet to do so.
  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives:
harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating
risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based
regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures
against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more
technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated
misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright,
discrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but
important role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.
  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic
societies can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various
domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit
remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising
questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This
study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image)
dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science
competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived
such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for
others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The
Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical
programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current
LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian),
providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition
settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding
educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM
usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and
policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly
available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational
application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using
the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.

Result: AI可以高保真地复制研究员的写作风格、领域知识和修辞特点，非文本数据和元数据可进一步丰富表现。

Conclusion: AI驱动的电子副本为智力遗产保存提供了新机会，但需重视伦理和安全性问题。

Abstract: This article explores the feasibility of creating an "electronic copy" of a
deceased researcher by training artificial intelligence (AI) on the data stored
in their personal computers. By analyzing typical data volumes on inherited
researcher computers, including textual files such as articles, emails, and
drafts, it is estimated that approximately one million words are available for
AI training. This volume is sufficient for fine-tuning advanced pre-trained
models like GPT-4 to replicate a researcher's writing style, domain expertise,
and rhetorical voice with high fidelity. The study also discusses the potential
enhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the
AI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include
communication between living researchers and their electronic copies,
collaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and
interconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information
access and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership
and security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for
responsible implementation. The findings suggest promising opportunities for
AI-driven preservation and augmentation of intellectual legacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解神经调节剂（如乙酰胆碱和去甲肾上腺素）如何通过调节神经元增益和抑制门控来平衡大脑的可塑性与稳定性。

Method: 开发了一个基于Izhikevich模型的双室模型，模拟了皮层第5层锥体神经元及其与抑制性中间神经元的连接，结合高斯连接性和突触可塑性（STDP）。

Result: 模型显示，更强的树突驱动或更紧密的耦合会通过增加钙触发的体细胞爆发的可能性来提高增益，而树突靶向抑制会降低增益。

Conclusion: 神经调节剂驱动的短暂增益脉冲可能作为一种自适应双时间尺度优化机制，有效调节突触权重更新。

Abstract: Biological and artificial learning systems alike confront the
plasticity-stability dilemma. In the brain, neuromodulators such as
acetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain
and inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed
by dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal
system, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant
substrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals
coincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a
single somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts
the output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that
translate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this
mechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons
and single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,
linked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).
The soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,
while dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by
shifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive
or tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of
calcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition
suppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold
of neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting
accelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and
flexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators
could serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively
modulating the synaptic weight updates.

Result: 舌位模式能区分两种方言，尤其在rhotic和低后元音上表现出显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果为自动口音分析和发音建模提供了有价值的发现。

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between accent strength and articulatory
features inferred from acoustic speech. To quantify accent strength, we compare
phonetic transcriptions with transcriptions based on dictionary-based
references, computing phoneme-level difference as a measure of accent strength.
The proposed framework leverages recent self-supervised learning articulatory
inversion techniques to estimate articulatory features. Analyzing a corpus of
read speech from American and British English speakers, this study examines
correlations between derived articulatory parameters and accent strength
proxies, associating systematic articulatory differences with indexed accent
strength. Results indicate that tongue positioning patterns distinguish the two
dialects, with notable differences inter-dialects in rhotic and low back
vowels. These findings contribute to automated accent analysis and articulatory
modeling for speech processing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非侵入式评估模型仅预测语音的单一平均意见分数（MOS），无法推广到语音以外的领域，且合并了多种感知因素。

Method: MMMOS融合了三个预训练编码器（WavLM、MuQ和M2D）的帧级嵌入，并评估了三种聚合策略和四种损失函数。通过集成前八个模型，提升了性能。

Result: MMMOS在均方误差上减少了20-30%，Kendall's τ提高了4-5%，在八个生产复杂性指标中六项排名第一，32项挑战指标中17项排名前三。

Conclusion: MMMOS在多领域音频质量评估中表现出色，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating
audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive
assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging
diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose
MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that
estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity,
Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and
environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained
encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with
four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30%
reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus
baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and
ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集，测试了六种公开嵌入模型和三种MLP分类器架构，并在集中式和联邦式配置下进行了实验。

Result: 结果表明，嵌入质量对预测性能的影响远大于分类器复杂性，联邦学习在理想条件下可接近集中式学习的效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为可扩展且隐私保护的医疗编码系统提供了可行路径，并为未来联邦学习和领域自适应临床AI研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of federated learning
(FL) for multi-label ICD code classification using clinical notes from the
MIMIC-IV dataset. Unlike previous approaches that rely on centralized training
or fine-tuned large language models, we propose a lightweight and scalable
pipeline combining frozen text embeddings with simple multilayer perceptron
(MLP) classifiers. This design offers a privacy-preserving and
deployment-efficient alternative for clinical NLP applications, particularly
suited to distributed healthcare settings. Extensive experiments across both
centralized and federated configurations were conducted, testing six publicly
available embedding models from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard
and three MLP classifier architectures under two medical coding (ICD-9 and
ICD-10). Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits
assess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially
outweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that
federated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized
conditions. While the models are orders of magnitude smaller than
state-of-the-art architectures and achieved competitive micro and macro F1
scores, limitations remain including the lack of end-to-end training and the
simplified FL assumptions. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates a viable way
toward scalable, privacy-conscious medical coding systems and offers a step
toward for future research into federated, domain-adaptive clinical AI.

Motivation: 研究领域特定专业化对LLMs检索能力的影响，以推动开发能够处理文本、代码、图像和多模态内容的统一检索器。

Method: 使用八种Qwen2.5 7B LLMs（包括基础、指令调优、代码/数学专业化、长推理和视觉语言模型），在零样本和监督设置下进行实验。

Result: 数学专业化和长推理能力导致检索性能下降，而视觉语言模型和代码专业化模型在零样本检索中表现优异，甚至超越BM25。

Conclusion: 研究结果为跨领域和多模态融合的统一检索任务提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense
retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval
effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines
how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities,
an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling
text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments
with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned,
code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across
zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot
retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code
retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance,
all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical
specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation
in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and
semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs
demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even
surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance
to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising
directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and
cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Although the amount of available spoken content is steadily increasing,
extracting information and knowledge from speech recordings remains
challenging. Beyond enhancing traditional information retrieval methods such as
speech search and keyword spotting, novel approaches for navigating and

propose a novel navigational method for speech archives that leverages recent
advances in language and multimodal generative models. We demonstrate our
approach with a Web application that organizes data into a structured format
using interactive mind maps and image generation tools. The system is
implemented using the TED-LIUM~3 dataset, which comprises over 2,000 speech
transcripts and audio files of TED Talks. Initial user tests using a System

Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration
of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement
learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have
traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through
Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin
destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected
tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a
consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization
across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports
multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups
with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor
decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large
scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control
strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and
operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT
framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and
practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation
integrated mobility systems.

Result: 在详细案例研究中，单词错误率（WER）降至2-7%，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该混合多阶段方法有效自动化了转录中最繁琐的部分，生成了高质量、可分析的输出，是当前技术环境中的实用解决方案。

Abstract: This article presents and validates an ideal, four-stage workflow for the
high-accuracy transcription and analysis of challenging medieval legal
documents. The process begins with a specialized Handwritten Text Recognition
(HTR) model, itself created using a novel "Clean Ground Truth" curation method
where a Large Language Model (LLM) refines the training data. This HTR model
provides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline
is fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal
post-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The
corrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a
prompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction
(NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for
ambiguous readings (Stage 4). We validate this workflow through detailed case
studies, achieving Word Error Rates (WER) in the range of 2-7% against
scholarly ground truths. The results demonstrate that this hybrid, multi-stage
approach effectively automates the most laborious aspects of transcription
while producing a high-quality, analyzable output, representing a powerful and
practical solution for the current technological landscape.

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: 研究发现，过去30年美国股市的收益主要来自隔夜交易，而日内交易收益为负或持平。通过分析240万篇新闻文章，发现新闻主题的流行度和市场对新闻的反应是主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨美国股市隔夜收益显著高于日内收益的现象，并分析新闻对市场收益的影响。

Method: 使用240万篇新闻文章，采用监督式主题分析技术，筛选能解释市场收益的新闻主题。

Result: 新闻主题的流行度和市场反应共同导致隔夜与日内收益差异。方法能预测隔夜表现优异和日内表现不佳的股票。

Conclusion: 新闻是解释隔夜收益的重要机制，与其他文献提出的机制形成对比。

Abstract: Over the past 30 years, nearly all the gains in the U.S. stock market have
been earned overnight, while average intraday returns have been negative or
flat. We find that a large part of this effect can be explained through
features of intraday and overnight news. Our analysis uses a collection of 2.4
million news articles. We apply a novel technique for supervised topic analysis
that selects news topics based on their ability to explain contemporaneous
market returns. We find that time variation in the prevalence of news topics
and differences in the responses to news topics both contribute to the
difference in intraday and overnight returns. In out-of-sample tests, our
approach forecasts which stocks will do particularly well overnight and
particularly poorly intraday. Our approach also helps explain patterns of
continuation and reversal in intraday and overnight returns. We contrast the
effect of news with other mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain
overnight returns.

Conclusion: 人类与AI协作在实体产品设计中具有潜力，为整合人类反馈到AI设计流程提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: This study explores how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, guided by
human aesthetic evaluations, can enhance the outputs of generative AI models in
tangible product design, using lamp design as a case study. By integrating
human feedback into the AI model, we aim to improve both the desirability and
aesthetic appeal of the generated designs. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted, starting with prompt optimization techniques and focusing on LoRA
fine-tuning of the Stable Diffusion model. Additionally, methods to convert
AI-generated designs into tangible products through 3D realization using 3D
printing technologies were investigated. The results indicate that LoRA
fine-tuning effectively aligns AI-generated designs with human aesthetic
preferences, leading to significant improvements in desirability and aesthetic
appeal scores. These findings highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration
in tangible product design and provide valuable insights into integrating human
feedback into AI design processes.

Motivation: 解决平行坐标图（PCPs）在多指标情况下无法直观提供颜色渐变的问题。

Method: 基于特定偏好指标组合计算最优权重，利用雷达图和UMAP降维实现多指标问题的可视化选择。

Result: 在行人流引导规划分析中，方法成功识别了不同用户偏好下的控制参数重要性模式。

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持用户在多指标情况下直观选择偏好，并揭示参数重要性模式。

Abstract: Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a prevalent method to interpret the
relationship between the control parameters and metrics. PCPs deliver such an
interpretation by color gradation based on a single metric. However, it is
challenging to provide such a gradation when multiple metrics are present.
Although a naive approach involves calculating a single metric by linearly
weighting each metric, such weighting is unclear for users. To address this
problem, we first propose a principled formulation for calculating the optimal
weight based on a specific preferred metric combination. Although users can
simply select their preference from a two-dimensional (2D) plane for bi-metric
problems, multi-metric problems require intuitive visualization to allow them
to select their preference. We achieved this using various radar charts to
visualize the metric trade-offs on the 2D plane reduced by UMAP. In the
analysis using pedestrian flow guidance planning, our method identified unique
patterns of control parameter importance for each user preference, highlighting
the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals need effective ways to use, understand, and validate
AI-driven clinical decision support systems. Existing systems face two key

evidence. We present an integrated decision support system that combines
interactive visualizations with a conversational agent to explain diabetes risk
assessments. We propose a hybrid prompt handling approach combining fine-tuned
language models for analytical queries with general Large Language Models
(LLMs) for broader medical questions, a methodology for grounding AI
explanations in scientific evidence, and a feature range analysis technique to
support deeper understanding of feature contributions. We conducted a
mixed-methods study with 30 healthcare professionals and found that the
conversational interactions helped healthcare professionals build a clear
understanding of model assessments, while the integration of scientific
evidence calibrated trust in the system's decisions. Most participants reported
that the system supported both patient risk evaluation and recommendation.

Motivation: 当前数字人类创建的瓶颈在于生成与文本或语音输入自然对应的角色动作。

Method: DeepGesture基于DiffuseStyleGesture模型，引入了快速文本转录作为语义条件，并采用情感引导的无分类器扩散方法。使用轻量级Transformer骨干网络融合多模态特征。

Result: 在ZeroEGGS数据集上评估，DeepGesture在手势的人类相似性和上下文适当性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DeepGesture在情感状态插值和泛化能力上表现出色，推动了多模态、情感感知数字人类的发展。

Abstract: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech
synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics,
the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character
movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs.
  In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis
framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on
multimodal signals-text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the
DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural
enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in
generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as
semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to
support controllable gesture generation across affective states. A lightweight
Transformer backbone combines full self-attention and cross-local attention for
effective feature fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To visualize results, we
implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the
model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces
gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness,
outperforming baselines on Mean Opinion Score and Frechet Gesture Distance
metrics. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and
demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic
voices-marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware
digital humans.

Motivation: 研究如何通过界面设计鼓励用户输入更长的提示，以增强其对生成内容的心理所有权感。

Method: 采用两种交互技术（长按提交按钮和滑动滑块）进行实验，并进一步测试AI生成建议的效果。

Result: 交互技术显著增加提示长度和心理所有权感，AI建议仅增加提示长度。

Conclusion: 简单的界面修改可有效提升用户输入量和心理所有权感。

Abstract: Writing longer prompts for an AI assistant to generate a short story
increases psychological ownership, a user's feeling that the writing belongs to
them. To encourage users to write longer prompts, we evaluated two interaction
techniques that modify the prompt entry interface of chat-based generative AI
assistants: pressing and holding the prompt submission button, and continuously
moving a slider up and down when submitting a short prompt. A within-subjects
experiment investigated the effects of such techniques on prompt length and
psychological ownership, and results showed that these techniques increased
prompt length and led to higher psychological ownership than baseline
techniques. A second experiment further augmented these techniques by showing
AI-generated suggestions for how the prompts could be expanded. This further
increased prompt length, but did not lead to improvements in psychological
ownership. Our results show that simple interface modifications like these can
elicit more writing from users and improve psychological ownership.

Gemini, and PaLM, and map their integration across the design lifecycle, from
ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering,
human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping

collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在心理学研究中的应用日益广泛，但测量不可靠性（如人格评估崩溃、道德偏好反转等）威胁研究有效性。

Method: 基于双效度框架，提出六阶段工作流程，包括明确研究目标、验证计算工具、控制计算混淆、透明执行协议等。

Result: 通过系统验证，可以区分真实的计算现象与测量假象，为AI心理学研究建立稳健的实证基础。

Conclusion: 工作流程为LLMs在心理学研究中的有效应用提供了路径，强调透明实践和验证工具的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological
research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive
models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability:
Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences
reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely
with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts
masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing
body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates
psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that
scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text
requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological
properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1)
explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,
(2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric
testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4)
execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate
for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated
boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through
an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic
validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement
artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent
practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical
foundation for AI psychology research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计高效的动态选择策略对SAEAs至关重要，但传统方法需要大量人工和领域知识，因此提出利用LLMs自动化这一过程。

Method: LLM-SAEA采用专家协作框架，一个LLM作为评分专家（LLM-SE）评估模型和标准，另一个LLM作为决策专家（LLM-DE）选择最优配置。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-SAEA在标准测试案例中优于多种先进算法。

Conclusion: LLM-SAEA通过LLMs的集成，显著提升了SAEAs的效率和性能，为自动化优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for
addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily
dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria.
However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is
labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large
language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling
criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts
framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores
to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization
performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting
the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current
optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms
several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases. The source code

Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds
of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic
field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training
algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric
recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++
environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric
recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons
determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic
field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated
system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial
conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional
viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can
obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field,
without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or
massive training datasets.

Motivation: 解决现有搜索方法无法直接使用SynOps作为约束的问题，以实现SNN的高效压缩。

Method: 提出SPEAR框架，结合SynOps预测机制LRE和强化学习奖励TAR，稳定搜索过程。

Result: 实验证明SPEAR能有效压缩SNN，满足特定SynOps约束。

Conclusion: SPEAR为资源受限的神经形态硬件部署SNN提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance,
their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains
challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both
parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment
of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure
after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use
SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching
process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps
target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR,
which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as
the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we
first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict
the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated
and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR
to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework
can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

suggestions are made on the initial pattern so as to evolve faster to market

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不应期机制在低延迟SNN中效果不佳，可能导致神经元过度激活和噪声抵抗力下降。

Method: 利用膜电位导数与历史不应期估计初始不应期，并动态调整其时长；提出阈值依赖性不应期核以减少神经元状态积累。

Result: HDRP-SNN显著减少冗余脉冲，在静态和神经形态数据集上达到SOTA准确率，噪声抵抗力优于ANN和传统SNN。

Conclusion: HDRP机制在提升低延迟SNN性能中起关键作用。

Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network
stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network
(SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In
low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory
mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less
effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron
over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this
challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that
leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to
estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration.
Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate
excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary
characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall
performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces
redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover,
HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in
noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in
enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming,
error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce
AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable

a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics
system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned
distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code
generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The
system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering
ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular
genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration
reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export.
We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user

Abstract: The high computational cost and power consumption of current and anticipated
AI systems present a major challenge for widespread deployment and further
scaling. Current hardware approaches face fundamental efficiency limits. This
paper introduces ZettaLith, a scalable computing architecture designed to
reduce the cost and power of AI inference by over 1,000x compared to current
GPU-based systems. Based on architectural analysis and technology projections,
a single ZettaLith rack could potentially achieve 1.507 zettaFLOPS in 2027 -
representing a theoretical 1,047x improvement in inference performance, 1,490x
better power efficiency, and could be 2,325x more cost-effective than current
leading GPU racks for FP4 transformer inference. The ZettaLith architecture
achieves these gains by abandoning general purpose GPU applications, and via
the multiplicative effect of numerous co-designed architectural innovations
using established digital electronic technologies, as detailed in this paper.
ZettaLith's core architectural principles scale down efficiently to exaFLOPS
desktop systems and petaFLOPS mobile chips, maintaining their roughly 1,000x
advantage. ZettaLith presents a simpler system architecture compared to the
complex hierarchy of current GPU clusters. ZettaLith is optimized exclusively
for AI inference and is not applicable for AI training.

TL;DR: Symbiosis提出了一种参数高效微调（PEFT）的框架，解决了现有框架在多适配器推理和微调中的资源浪费、灵活性不足和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT框架在多适配器场景下存在GPU资源浪费、灵活性不足和隐私泄露问题。

Method: Symbiosis通过共享基础模型层和分离执行适配器层，实现了资源高效共享和灵活管理。

Result: 在Llama2-13B上，Symbiosis比基线方法在同一时间内多微调4倍的适配器。

Conclusion: Symbiosis为多适配器场景提供了高效、灵活且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the
task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the
original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to
creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or
fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning,
each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in
excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular
inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow
independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They
cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and
fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to
expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we
address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model.
The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning
processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of
client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering
them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method,
to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and
works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our
evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can
fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: MLLMs在网球视频分析中具有潜力，需进一步优化以提高性能。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Conclusion: OBSER框架实现了零样本环境识别，为自主环境理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment

Result: GameTileNet支持叙事驱动的游戏内容生成，并为低分辨率非真实感图像的对象检测提供基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet是改进程序化内容生成方法和支持丰富叙事游戏内容的宝贵资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在长视频理解中因时间感知效率低下而表现不佳，TS旨在通过动态调整时间关注区域解决这一问题。

Method: TS通过两阶段迭代：1）提出可能包含任务相关信息的时间区间；2）从中采样固定数量帧并生成置信度评分，逐步细化关注区域。还引入TS-BFS策略优化搜索效率。

Result: TS通过动态调整时间关注区域，显著提升了MLLMs在长视频理解中的性能。

Conclusion: TS为MLLMs提供了一种高效的长视频理解方法，无需额外训练，且通过TS-BFS进一步提升了效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Conclusion: DriveMRP-Agent框架显著提升VLM的运动风险预测性能，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

Method: 采用概率生成模型或图像集表示概念，从中采样生成多样化的对抗样本，保持原始概念不变。

Result: 实验证明该方法能生成更多样化的对抗样本，同时保持概念一致性，攻击效率更高。

Conclusion: 基于概念的对抗攻击框架在多样性和效率上优于传统方法，为对抗攻击研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Abstract: Condition monitoring subsea pipelines in low-visibility underwater

comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and
their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and
low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured

target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated
that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中深度融合与计算可扩展性之间的矛盾，特别是在模态数量较多时。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI基准测试中表现优异，生成结构化、类别可分的表示。

Conclusion: GRF为高效、强大的多模态表示学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Result: 模型规模增大时，VLMs表现出更强的迎合性但更少的权威偏见，人类实验验证了行为差异。

Conclusion: 研究为理解VLMs幻觉提供了新视角，强调将心理学原则融入模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

Result: LATTE在多个基准测试（如GenImage和DiffusionFake）中表现优于基线，并在跨生成器和跨数据集场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: LATTE展示了潜在轨迹嵌入在生成图像检测中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医学图像分割中因学习虚假相关性而泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 提出Causal-SAM-LLM框架，结合Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement（LAD）和Test-Time Causal Intervention（TCI）技术。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上，平均Dice分数提升6.2点，Hausdorff距离减少15.8 mm，且仅使用9%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建鲁棒、高效且可交互控制的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

Conclusion: 该方法通过图表示和LLM增强，显著提升了医学VQA的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的多模态墓碑数字化框架，显著提高了墓碑内容解析的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 墓碑作为历史文化载体面临保存挑战，需数字化手段提升其内容解读与保存。

Method: 利用VLM将墓碑图像转化为结构化表示（TMR），并结合检索增强生成（RAG）整合外部语义信息。

Result: 解析准确率从传统OCR的36.1 F1提升至89.5，并在多语言文化场景下验证了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次将大视觉语言模型应用于墓碑理解，对文化遗产保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大豆猝死综合征（SDS）对大豆生产构成严重威胁，需要早期检测方法以避免产量损失。

Method: 使用高光谱成像系统扫描叶片样本，通过遗传算法选择关键波长，结合CNN提取特征，并用多种机器学习模型分类。

Result: 集成分类器（如随机森林、AdaBoost）、线性SVM和神经网络达到最高准确率（>98%），高斯过程和QDA表现不佳。

Conclusion: 开发的网络应用支持快速、可访问的植物病害诊断，未来将扩展数据集以涵盖更多条件和作物。

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM2Vec-V2是一个统一的多模态嵌入框架，支持文本、图像、视频和视觉文档输入，解决了现有模型对视频和视觉文档支持不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态嵌入模型（如VLM2Vec、E5-V、GME）主要针对自然图像，对其他视觉形式（如视频和视觉文档）支持有限，限制了其在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出VLM2Vec-V2框架，并扩展MMEB-V2基准，新增五种任务类型（视觉文档检索、视频检索等）。

Result: VLM2Vec-V2在新任务和原有图像基准上均表现优异，验证了其通用性和性能提升。

Conclusion: VLM2Vec-V2为多模态嵌入学习提供了统一框架，为研究和实际应用中的可扩展表示学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

Motivation: 解决数学实践哲学（PMP）中案例选择偏差和文件抽屉问题，通过大规模语料分析提供更客观的证据。

Method: 利用Gemini 2.5 Pro模型分析arXiv.org上的5000篇数学论文，提取并标注数百个解释性案例。

Result: 生成包含大量非选择性案例的数据集，用于分析数学家解释实践的频率、学科差异及与哲学理论的一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究为PMP提供了新方法，展示了AI工具在哲学研究中的潜力，并探讨了当前模型的优缺点。

Abstract: The philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP) looks to evidence from working
mathematics to help settle philosophical questions. One prominent program under
the PMP banner is the study of explanation in mathematics, which aims to
understand what sorts of proofs mathematicians consider explanatory and what
role the pursuit of explanation plays in mathematical practice. In an effort to
address worries about cherry-picked examples and file-drawer problems in PMP, a
handful of authors have recently turned to corpus analysis methods as a
promising alternative to small-scale case studies. This paper reports the
results from such a corpus study facilitated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, a
model whose reasoning capabilities, advances in hallucination control and large
context window allow for the accurate analysis of hundreds of pages of text per
query. Based on a sample of 5000 mathematics papers from arXiv.org, the
experiments yielded a dataset of hundreds of useful annotated examples. Its aim
was to gain insight on questions like the following: How often do
mathematicians make claims about explanation in the relevant sense? Do
mathematicians' explanatory practices vary in any noticeable way by subject
matter? Which philosophical theories of explanation are most consistent with a
large body of non-cherry-picked examples? How might philosophers make further
use of AI tools to gain insights from large datasets of this kind? As the first
PMP study making extensive use of LLM methods, it also seeks to begin a
conversation about these methods as research tools in practice-oriented
philosophy and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current models for
such work.

TL;DR: DSPy框架通过程序化优化提示，提升LLM性能，效果因任务而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动设计提示的低效问题，探索程序化优化提示的潜力。

Method: 使用DSPy框架在五个用例中优化提示，评估性能变化。

Result: 部分任务性能显著提升（如提示评估准确率从46.2%升至64.0%），部分任务改进有限。

Conclusion: DSPy能有效优化提示，但效果因任务而异，需结合具体用例评估。

Abstract: Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This
study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization
framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five
use cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code
generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how
prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases
demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use
case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed
notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a
substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the
router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and
of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was
explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%,
using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.
Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt
optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning
and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by
task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt
optimization research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于少样本学习（FSL）的新方法，用于检测持续集成中的间歇性任务失败，解决了现有启发式方法的误标问题，并在多个项目中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则（如任务重试）标记间歇性失败，但在某些场景下会误标，导致性能下降。手动标注成本高，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用少样本学习（FSL），通过少量手动标注的日志样本微调小型语言模型，生成丰富的嵌入表示，再训练分类器。

Result: 在12个样本下，FSL方法在多个项目中达到70-88%的F1分数，显著优于现有方法（34-52%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明数据质量比数量更重要，并提供了一个更高效、实用的间歇性任务失败检测框架。

Abstract: One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous
integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job
failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky
tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such
as bugs. Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large
datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or
regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on
non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job
failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not
an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In
fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1
open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job
failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using
few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model
using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich
embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based
approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects,
outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4
projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over
quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the
detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开发者广泛采用LLM助手，需系统评估其对开发效率的多维影响，填补研究空白。

Method: 对2014年至2024年的37项同行评审研究进行系统性文献综述。

Result: LLM助手在提升效率（如减少代码搜索时间）的同时，也带来认知卸载和团队协作减少等问题。研究多聚焦满意度、性能和效率，沟通和活动维度研究不足。

Conclusion: 未来研究需更多整合多维度评估，尤其是纵向和团队层面的研究。所有研究资料已公开。

Abstract: Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to
transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these
tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and
design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how
LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we
present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published
between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis
reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical
risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated
development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However,
studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team
collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of
studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two
SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer
productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial
room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency
are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and
Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and
methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations.
This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future
research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly

TL;DR: 论文探讨Bittensor是否能成为去中心化人工智能领域的比特币，通过比较其代币经济学、去中心化特性、共识机制和激励结构与比特币的异同。研究发现Bittensor存在权益和奖励的高度集中问题，并提出协议级干预措施以优化激励和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Bittensor是否能像比特币在其领域一样成为去中心化人工智能的标杆，并解决其当前存在的激励和安全问题。

Method: 利用Bittensor所有64个活跃子网的链上数据，分析权益和奖励的集中情况，并提出协议级干预措施（如绩效加权排放分配、复合评分和信任奖励乘数）以优化激励结构。

Result: 研究发现Bittensor的权益和奖励高度集中，且奖励主要依赖权益而非质量。提出的干预措施（如权益上限）能显著提升安全性。

Conclusion: Bittensor目前尚不具备比特币的去中心化特性，但通过协议级干预措施可以优化其激励结构和安全性，使其更接近目标。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bittensor can be considered the Bitcoin of
decentralized Artificial Intelligence by directly comparing its tokenomics,
decentralization properties, consensus mechanism, and incentive structure
against those of Bitcoin. Leveraging on-chain data from all 64 active Bittensor
subnets, we first document considerable concentration in both stake and
rewards. We further show that rewards are overwhelmingly driven by stake,
highlighting a clear misalignment between quality and compensation. As a
remedy, we put forward a series of two-pronged protocol-level interventions.
For incentive realignment, our proposed solutions include performance-weighted
emission split, composite scoring, and a trust-bonus multiplier. As for
mitigating security vulnerability due to stake concentration, we propose and
empirically validate stake cap at the 88th percentile, which elevates the
median coalition size required for a 51-percent attack and remains robust
across daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.

Motivation: 多轮越狱攻击对LLM系统的安全部署构成威胁，现有单轮防御措施无法应对此类攻击。

Method: 通过分析Crescendo多轮越狱攻击在模型中间表示层面的效果，研究其如何逐步引导模型输出。

Result: Crescendo攻击使模型在多轮对话中将有害请求表示为无害，导致防御失效。

Conclusion: 需开发针对多轮攻击的防御措施，弥补单轮防御的不足。

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that state-of-the-art LLMs and defenses
remain susceptible to multi-turn jailbreak attacks. These attacks require only
closed-box model access and are often easy to perform manually, posing a
significant threat to the safe and secure deployment of LLM-based systems. We
study the effectiveness of the Crescendo multi-turn jailbreak at the level of
intermediate model representations and find that safety-aligned LMs often
represent Crescendo responses as more benign than harmful, especially as the
number of conversation turns increases. Our analysis indicates that at each
turn, Crescendo prompts tend to keep model outputs in a "benign" region of
representation space, effectively tricking the model into fulfilling harmful
requests. Further, our results help explain why single-turn jailbreak defenses
like circuit breakers are generally ineffective against multi-turn attacks,
motivating the development of mitigations that address this generalization gap.

Motivation: 降低标记样本的成本，通过主动学习选择模型最不确定的样本进行标记，结合贝叶斯理论提供概率视角。

Method: 提出两种模型：Inception-V4+PCA结合多种SVM算法，以及基于Vision Transformer的贝叶斯神经网络ViT-BNN。

Result: 实验表明ViT-BNN在处理不确定性时更稳定和鲁棒。

Conclusion: ViT-BNN是一种先进的主动学习方法，适用于多种任务，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Active learning for classification seeks to reduce the cost of labeling
samples by finding unlabeled examples about which the current model is least
certain and sending them to an annotator/expert to label. Bayesian theory can
provide a probabilistic view of deep neural network models by asserting a prior
distribution over model parameters and estimating the uncertainties by
posterior distribution over these parameters. This paper proposes two novel
active learning approaches to label one million malware examples belonging to
different unknown modern malware families. The first model is Inception-V4+PCA
combined with several support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (UTSVM, PSVM,
SVM-GSU, TBSVM). The second model is Vision Transformer based Bayesian Neural
Networks ViT-BNN. Our proposed ViT-BNN is a state-of-the-art active learning
approach that differs from current methods and can apply to any particular
task. The experiments demonstrate that the ViT-BNN is more stable and robust in
handling uncertainty.

Motivation: 隐私政策通常冗长复杂，非专家用户难以理解，导致个人数据处理缺乏透明度。随着隐私问题日益突出，开发自动化工具分析隐私政策并识别潜在风险变得至关重要。

Method: 采用交互式图可视化技术，将政策条款表示为结构化图模型，并利用图挖掘算法（如t-SNE和PCA）识别关键主题（如用户活动和设备信息）。

Result: 研究发现，基于图的聚类提高了政策内容的可解释性，揭示了用户跟踪和数据共享的模式，支持法医调查和识别违规行为。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合交互式可视化与图挖掘，推动了AI驱动的隐私政策审计工具的发展，增强了透明度和信任。

Abstract: Privacy policy documents are often lengthy, complex, and difficult for
non-expert users to interpret, leading to a lack of transparency regarding the
collection, processing, and sharing of personal data. As concerns over online
privacy grow, it is essential to develop automated tools capable of analyzing
privacy policies and identifying potential risks. In this study, we explore the
potential of interactive graph visualizations to enhance user understanding of
privacy policies by representing policy terms as structured graph models. This
approach makes complex relationships more accessible and enables users to make
informed decisions about their personal data (RQ1). We also employ graph mining
algorithms to identify key themes, such as User Activity and Device
Information, using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and PCA to
assess clustering effectiveness. Our findings reveal that graph-based
clustering improves policy content interpretability. It highlights patterns in
user tracking and data sharing, which supports forensic investigations and
identifies regulatory non-compliance. This research advances AI-driven tools
for auditing privacy policies by integrating interactive visualizations with
graph mining. Enhanced transparency fosters accountability and trust.

Motivation: 随着LLM训练成本上升和模型重用普及，版权和知识产权保护面临挑战，现有水印技术难以应对持续训练带来的威胁。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，并发现华为的Pangu Pro MoE模型可能源自Qwen-2.5 14B模型。

Conclusion: 开发稳健的指纹方法对保护LLM知识产权至关重要，持续训练无法完全掩盖模型来源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant copyright and intellectual
property challenges as the cost of training increases and model reuse becomes
prevalent. While watermarking techniques have been proposed to protect model
ownership, they may not be robust to continue training and development, posing
serious threats to model attribution and copyright protection. This work
introduces a simple yet effective approach for robust LLM fingerprinting based
on intrinsic model characteristics. We discover that the standard deviation
distributions of attention parameter matrices across different layers exhibit
distinctive patterns that remain stable even after extensive continued
training. These parameter distribution signatures serve as robust fingerprints
that can reliably identify model lineage and detect potential copyright
infringement. Our experimental validation across multiple model families
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for model authentication. Notably,
our investigation uncovers evidence that a recently Pangu Pro MoE model
released by Huawei is derived from Qwen-2.5 14B model through upcycling
techniques rather than training from scratch, highlighting potential cases of
model plagiarism, copyright violation, and information fabrication. These
findings underscore the critical importance of developing robust fingerprinting
methods for protecting intellectual property in large-scale model development
and emphasize that deliberate continued training alone is insufficient to
completely obscure model origins.

Conclusion: RL训练能显著提升LLM在漏洞检测中的表现和推理能力。

Abstract: Improving and understanding the training dynamics and reasoning of Large
Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for their deployment in AI-based
security tools, such as software vulnerability detection. In this work, we
present an extensive study aimed at advancing recent RL-based finetuning
techniques for LLMs in the context of vulnerability detection.
  We start by highlighting key limitations of commonly adopted LLMs, such as
their tendency to over-predict certain types of vulnerabilities while failing
to detect others. To address this challenge, we explore the use of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent policy-gradient method, for
guiding LLM behavior through structured, rule-based rewards. We enable its
application to the vulnerability detection task by redefining its advantage
functions and reward signals using annotations from widely used datasets in the
field, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and CleanVul.
  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing
multiple research questions regarding the impact of GRPO on generalization,
reasoning capabilities, and performance improvements over standard supervised
finetuning (SFT). Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of
RL-based training to enhance both the performance and reasoning abilities of
LLMs in the context of software vulnerability detection.

Abstract: Today's Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from simple sensing and
actuation devices to those with embedded processing and intelligent services,
enabling rich collaborations between users and their devices. However, enabling
such collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact
with host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases,
fine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure
interactions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for
non-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically
configure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules.
Additionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.
  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and
seamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs
a Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level
intents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless
device collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for
authorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing
hardware-independent abstractions.
  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto
configuration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in
large-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation
pipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100%
accuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new
devices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of
up to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and
technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit
vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.
However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this
paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:
Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the
attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack
process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is
consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token
replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.
Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token
Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention
Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of
mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,
a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the
attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four
leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)
show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while
maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention
Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it
an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The safety alignment of Language Models (LMs) is a critical concern, yet
their integrity can be challenged by direct parameter manipulation attacks,
such as those potentially induced by fault injection. As LMs are increasingly
deployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper
investigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across
different quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a
tailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a
comparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on
Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and
weight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization
significantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high
success (>80\% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack
budget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20\% and
50\%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8
models maintained ASR below 65\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to
INT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation
locations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes,
with (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides,
jailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent
FP8/INT8 quantization (<5\% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced
transferred ASR (avg. 35\% drop). These findings highlight that while common
quantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct
parameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist,
especially through post-attack quantization.
