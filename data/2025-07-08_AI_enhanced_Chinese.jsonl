However, existing structured\nprompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,\nand often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking\ncritical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in\nmulti-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce\nCodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and\nenables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems.

This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into\ncohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs.

We present\nTomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting\nand responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of\nTomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,\nfew-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,\nchain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and\ninformation about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP).

Plummer"], "title": "Beyond Token Pruning: Operation Pruning in Vision-Language Models", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by\neliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while\nmaintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach\nconflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along\nwith discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant\noperations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP\ndetermines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP\niteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance\ndrop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets\ncan be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according\nto this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency\nthrough: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant\nevaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune\" and ``danger-to-prune\"\noperations from sorting.

In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep\nReinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM\ndifferences between tasks based on interaction data approximation.

However, LLMs\noften fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated\nresponses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we\nintroduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to\nwhich retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We\nsystematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual\nconsistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as\nRAG-ability.

However, traditional approaches rely\non human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often\noverlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other\nmulti-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory\nSynergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language\nmodels as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and\nphenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of\nconcept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --\nspanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which\nspontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,\nself-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical\ncorrelations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for\nphenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's\ncapabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the\nheart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging\nphenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional\nconfounder variables beyond standard demographic factors.

Furthermore,\nsequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:\nquadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these\nlimitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less\nreliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce\nEcho State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves\nthis challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.\nEST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from\nReservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.\nDrawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of\nthe Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module\ncalled ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent\nnetworks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory\nunits with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical\nreservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the\nEST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By\nmaintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST\nachieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively\nbreaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on\nthe STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,\ndemonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of\nthese tasks.

However, the concepts are\nfrequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy\ndiscourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain\nunder meaningful human supervision.\n  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision\noutside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to\nAI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and\noperational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either\na policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims\nto prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,\nremediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight\nstrategies nonetheless necessitate control.\n  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some\nboundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,\nand where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the\nquestion of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment\ncontext, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying\nboth present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical\nadvances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u533a\u5206\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6210\u719f\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u8fb9\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6210\u719f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u533a\u5206\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u8df5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6210\u719f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

An evaluation of the\nproposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its\nimpact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and\nsensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study\ninvolved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization\nalgorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)\napplied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that\nthe proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system\nperformance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate\nconfidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of\nthe proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an\nexisting approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining\nour proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs).

In addition to achieving high accuracy,\nthe model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform\nwell across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not\ntask-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the\nunderlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We\nfurther explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,\nrevealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is\ncrucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.\nThe improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for\nintelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent\neducation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff08MWPs\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29BERT\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29BERT\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281/12\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8fd190%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a\nlightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),\nwhich transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex\nteacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher\nmodel follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its\nlatent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency\ntrends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).\nHowever, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in\nslow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a\nfrequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale\nspectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low\nfrequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both\nlocal fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental\nresults show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions\nof up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.\nThe framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term\ntrends while reducing computational complexity.

Unifying the neural and symbolic\nmethods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as\nthere is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural\nnetworks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and\nspecific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified\nneurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning.

Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is\nproposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as\nwell as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In\nthis way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by\nmerging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is\nproposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations\nover the reasoning graph.

This work presents an integrated experimental and computational\ninvestigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed\ndigital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining\nsoft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across\nthree strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent\nresponses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we\ndevelop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially\ninput convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent\nhyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)\nformulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with\nrespect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on\ncomposition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification.

We then leverage the influence\nof the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private\ndomains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative\ntraining fashion by either model merging or federated learning.

Recently,\nDeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire\nreasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without\nrequiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement\nlearning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding.

This paper explores alternatives by comparing the\nestablished method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic\nsignal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with\nunigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)\nderived from a pair-hidden Markov model.

Also, the\nintrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.\nResults show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with\nlinguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides\na clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable\nalternative to traditional cognate-based methods.

While\ncomputational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease\ndetection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and\nbiases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and\nexpert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and\nthe cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial\nnoise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,\ntransformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels\nwith a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from\nEHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and\ngeneralizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the\nscope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning\nembeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence\npatterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level\nrepresentations via a multi-layer transformer architecture.

On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical\ntranscription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete\non-device browser deployment.

This paper argues that recent advances in neural\nnetworks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --\nrepresent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an\nexisting experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules\nformulated over logical concepts.

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further\nimprove over vanilla self consistency.

To address this challenge, we propose\nOptimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.\nThe core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per\ncomponent, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each\ncomponent's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each\niteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while\nsimultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables\nindependent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated\noptimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead\nto performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world\ncompound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an\naverage improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for\nimproving compound systems.

While the \"LM-as-judge\" paradigm (a LM\nevaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss\nsubtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we\npropose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to\ntrain evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are\nfactually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or\nreference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a\ndataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a\nphysician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6\ndiverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,\nproprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly\nimproves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,\nincreasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety\nclassification scores up to 86%.

The former treats all temporal information of each variable as\na token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,\nwhile the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each\ntime step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current\nmainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.\nTransformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention\nmechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and\nsuffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in\nlong-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models\n(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but\nstruggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome\nthe limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel\nforecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series\nforecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a\nchannel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the\nTransformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model\ncross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two\ndistinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These\nrepresentations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a\ntemporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively.

We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising\ndecades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel\ndevelopmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems\nthrough this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with\nhuman behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the\nstrongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape\nrecognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image\ncorruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming\nhigh parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,\nwe provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way\nhow a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a\nresource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DVD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u6210\u719f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d1\u5c55\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u996e\u98df\uff08DVD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6297\u56fe\u50cf\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a\nmemory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to\nmulti-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute\nthroughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading\nmodel parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with\ndual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its\nsingle-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we\npresent DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed\nzeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:\n(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed\nforward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted\nto the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism\ndesign that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication\nbottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware\ncommunication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them\nacross GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink.

In this setting, an LLM\nagent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant\ninformation from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper\nexplores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected\nnumber of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy\nalgorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information\ngain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate\nestimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very\ndifficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which\nleads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better\nestimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information\nPursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on\nconformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship\nbetween prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate\nuncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast\nto conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a\ndistribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with\n20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter\nquery-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based\nchain-of-thought methods.

Neuroscience theory suggests\nthat mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a\nsemi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical\ncolumn. To address the disparity between biological and artificial\nintelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the\narchitecture of cortical columns and their interactions.\n  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first\nimplementation of a thousand-brains system.

These representations include an emphasis on\nclassifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to\ndetect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and\nmodel-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled\nmovements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,\na design that can accommodate communication between modules to further\naccelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine\nMonty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,\nand computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to\ncurrent deep learning architectures.

However, the development of object-centric world models has\nlargely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as\nbasic geometries).

An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL\ncorpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all\nmentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.\nThis imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body\nrepresentation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose\nLumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through\nthree mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss\n(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head\nover-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail\nRecommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to\nguide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a\nGPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically\ngenerates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity\nand distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly\nimprove recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and\nINSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over\nfifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,\ninformativeness, and long-tail relevance.

We observe\nthat verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct\nregions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and\ninjecting a \"steering vector\" to transition between these modes, we can\nreliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively\ncompressing CoTs without retraining.

In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,\nderived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate\nsteering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC\nachieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,\nwhile maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a\ntraining-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on\nMATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock\ntime on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for\nstreamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or\ncost-sensitive settings.

To\ncapture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human\nqueries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable\nefficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method\nthat allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,\navoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that\nTACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin.

Recent studies have revealed the sink token,\nwhich receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic\nrole. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens.

We showcase MLASDO using\ntranscriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease\n(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,\nMLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and\nPD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive\nT-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3).

The benchmark\nconsists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge,\nculturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate\nmultilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason\nabout Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance.\nTo systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation\nstrategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which\nmodels recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately.

While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their\nextension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,\nthe challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled\nphysical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses\na foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator\nreflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we\npresent the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet\nvariants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly\ncoupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with\ndual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional\ncoupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic\nthermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient\nphase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical\nDeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked\nusing both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our\nresults demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is\ncrucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch\ncounterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer\nadvantages for decoupled or single-physics problems.

As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on\ntheir ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their\nability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.\nWe further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including\ndifferent training methods and even using them together with other traditional\nmodels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u5206\u6790\u7f51\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u7403\u56de\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7403\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u7f51\u7403\u56de\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0cMLLMs\u6709\u671b\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7403\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ca\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLMs\u5728\u7f51\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work,\nrather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)\nand local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \\rat between\nrecurrence and attention mechanisms.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose \\textbf{S}elf-adaptive \\textbf{S}chema\n\\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate\nstructured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and\naccelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into\nthe output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves\nsubstantial improvements: 65\\% increase in structural adherence, 48\\%\nenhancement in content fidelity, and 17\\% reduction in hallucination rates\ncompared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and\npractical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text\ngeneration tasks.

However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined\neffects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different\nlocations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data\noften consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and\noccupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these\nvariables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to\ncapture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the\nMulti-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built\non the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles\nmultivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features.

However, they continue to struggle with long-form\nvideos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike\nhumans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate\nquery-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling\nacross the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of\nmissing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video.

The first one provides a\ncomprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that\nrelies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM\nutilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and\nefficient data assessment.

Its common\nsolution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a\nsubstitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This\nhinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit\nDFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,\ninspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness\non OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups\naccording to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and\nused for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as\nOOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge.

The\ndominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational\n\"meaning vectors.\" This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer\nmodels where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not\nfrom data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,\nprecomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is\ncompatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we\nintroduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,\nsemantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent\ntext, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with\ntrainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to\n\"representational interference\" in conventional models, where the embedding\nlayer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features.

While vector and graph\nembeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art\npipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for\ngiven full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to\nclassifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which\nfail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and\ninconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two\nclasses. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to\naddress this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order\nLogic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations\nthrough Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of\nthis approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,\ninconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the\nlimitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets\nannotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of\nthese approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical\nconnectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning.

The main challenge of HRL is efficient\ndiscovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this\nstructure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the\nsubgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to\nlearn it.

The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the\nthird chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient\nalgorithms.\n  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and\nextensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent\nactions.

We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a\ncognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also\naddresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization\nbehavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.\n  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon.

Although reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high\ncomputational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,\nparticularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA\n(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses\nEvolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for\ngradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable\nproperties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to\nsparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially\nwhen starting from a strong pre-trained policy.

However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or\nexternally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that\nhallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human\npsychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias.

Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit\nstronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting\nincreasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human\nsubject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural\ndifferences between VLMs and human respondents.

Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve\nuser knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of\ndetail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures\nbased on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are\nevaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen\nassistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage\narchitecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is\nthe framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only\nwhen there is related user knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728XHRI\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3HRI\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u533b\u9662\u5de1\u903b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u53a8\u623f\u52a9\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5148\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u518d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8be6\u7ec6\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u7528\u6237\u5177\u5907\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u5728XHRI\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u91ca\u8be6\u7ec6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Impressive developments from\ncompanies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about\ncatastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time\nfocussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved\ninto a \"pro-innovation\" strategy, in which the government directed existing\nregulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but\navoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived\nin late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The\nUK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and\nhosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU -\nrefrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new\ngovernment was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the\ntime of writing is yet to do so.\n  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives:\nharnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating\nrisk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based\nregulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures\nagainst risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more\ntechnical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated\nmisinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright,\ndiscrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but\nimportant role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.\n  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic\nsocieties can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u82f1\u56fd\u5728AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0a\u91c7\u53d6\u4e86\u4ecb\u4e8e\u6b27\u76df\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u7403AI\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u65e9\u671f\u5173\u6ce8\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6b67\u89c6\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u6765\u8f6c\u5411\u201c\u652f\u6301\u521b\u65b0\u201d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7ba1\u6280\u672f\u6216\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002ChatGPT\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u5f15\u53d1\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u82f1\u56fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u7acbAI\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u548c\u4e3e\u529e\u56fd\u9645\u5cf0\u4f1a\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u672a\u76d1\u7ba1\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5f00\u53d1\u30022024\u5e74\u65b0\u653f\u5e9c\u627f\u8bfa\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u5efa\u7acb\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u751f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u82f1\u56fd\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdbAI\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u7ba1\u63a7\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c11\u4e3b\u793e\u4f1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u793a\u8303\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u82f1\u56fdAI\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u73b0\u72b6\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u56fd\u5728AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u5b9a\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u63a7\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u82f1\u56fd\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u7075\u6d3b\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u6c11\u4e3b\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861AI\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

This can\nerode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable\ndetectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising\ncues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the\ninherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose\nLATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the\nevolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling\nthe trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE\ncaptures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated\nimages. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature\nrefinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it\nis fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight\nclassifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on\nseveral established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake.

To overcome this\nfundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that\nelevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our\nframework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,\nincorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial\nDisentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual\ndescriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's\nfeatures to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns\na representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time\nCausal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM\ninterprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation\ndecoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction.

Extensive experiments on\nvarious datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality\nup to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines\nwhile maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SOSAE\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff08\u5982\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SOSAE\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7d22\u5f15\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSOSAE\u80fd\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3130\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SOSAE\u4e3a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on\nnon-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job\nfailures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not\nan explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In\nfact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1\nopen-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\\% of intermittent job\nfailures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using\nfew-shot learning (FSL).

Developers are increasingly adopting these\ntools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and\ndesign.

In this paper, we\npresent a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published\nbetween January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis\nreveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical\nrisks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated\ndevelopment, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However,\nstudies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team\ncollaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of\nstudies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two\nSPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer\nproductivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial\nroom for more integrated evaluations.

Jailbreak attacks exploit\nvulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.\nHowever, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this\npaper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:\nAttention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the\nattention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack\nprocess, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is\nconsistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token\nreplacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.\nAdditionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token\nHighlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention\nSlipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of\nmitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,\na new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the\nattention score distribution using temperature scaling.

Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to\ncreation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models\n(LLMs).

Existing methods address\nstructural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start\ninference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,\nthis results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further\nchallenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention\nmask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a \"student\"\nprediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and\na \"teacher\" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This\nenables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby\nfully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To\nhandle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a\none-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature\ndata into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior\nperformance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "NTSFormer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u56feTransformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5b64\u7acb\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u56e0\u5b64\u7acb\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u964d\u7ea7\u4e3aMLP\u800c\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "NTSFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u90bb\u5c45\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cMoE\u8f93\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNTSFormer\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "NTSFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In the brain, neuromodulators such as\nacetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain\nand inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed\nby dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal\nsystem, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant\nsubstrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals\ncoincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a\nsingle somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts\nthe output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that\ntranslate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this\nmechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons\nand single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,\nlinked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).\nThe soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,\nwhile dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by\nshifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive\nor tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of\ncalcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition\nsuppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold\nof neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output.
