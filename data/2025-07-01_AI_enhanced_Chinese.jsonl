To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a\nthreshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of\nTensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the\nmodel's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to\nindividual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed\ndatasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed\nTDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of\nboth in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u8ddd\u79bb\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\uff08TDW\uff09\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff08TDWLFT\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ITS\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u56e0\u901a\u4fe1\u6545\u969c\u6216\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u800c\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u635f\u574f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5f20\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff08LFT\uff09\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9608\u503c\u8ddd\u79bb\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\uff08TDWLFT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u901f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTDWLFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TDWLFT\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfLFT\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We\ndevelop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning\ntraces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are\nfiltered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria\nselection algorithm.

This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate\nrisky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with\nactual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation\nstated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,\nand Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and\nChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk\npreferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)\nframework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than\nhuman participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human\ndecisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong\nindicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses\ncompared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation\nperformance.

Zhao", "Saurabh Bagchi"], "title": "Are Fast Methods Stable in Adversarially Robust Transfer Learning?", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "comment": "13 pages", "summary": "Transfer learning is often used to decrease the computational cost of model\ntraining, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the\nfeatures learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new\ntask. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as\nadversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.\nHowever, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial\ntraining during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of\nmagnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use\nof the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve\nthe computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that\nFGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from\nscratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with\ncatastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\\varepsilon=4$ or\n$\\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\\varepsilon=32$ for\nlinear probing.

To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational\nmessage passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a\n\\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this\nstrategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its\nincident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most\npertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is\neffectively fused with the central node's own representation using a\n\\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused\nnode message.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model.

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

Crucially, this\ngeneralization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and\nzero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision\nTransformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the\nloss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for\nunderstanding model space geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u7c7b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Vision Transformers\u548cGPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u6216\u96f6\u969c\u788d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fde\u63a5\uff08LMC\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6392\u5217\uff09\u4f7f\u5f97\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f97\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u7c7b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u6392\u5217\u3001\u534a\u6392\u5217\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bb8\u591a\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u4f8b\u5305\u542b\u5728\u5185\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Vision Transformers\u548cGPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u6216\u96f6\u969c\u788d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing MLLM\nbenchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating\nlong-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty\nand diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)\ninadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively\nevaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,\nchallenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring\nmulti-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple\ndifficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from\nfoundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated\ninto an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to\neliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust\nreasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed\nstep-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism\nto reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps.

Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for\niteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a\nuser-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes\nupdated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary\nof performance statistics from prior training rounds.

We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)\nand Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three\nsignificant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these\nfindings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B\n(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head\nspecialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by\nintroducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement\nverbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the\nlogit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the\nauthors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain\ncategories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction\ntoken as part of the subject of the sentence.

We conduct a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,\nsyntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.\nBased on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the\ndesign of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at\nhttps://github.com/zhaoyd1/compositional_SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5206\u53e5\u6cd5\u6811\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u53e5\u6cd5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53e5\u6cd5\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0fSLMs\u548c\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0fSLMs\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6458\u8981\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0fSLMs\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety\nanalysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for\nspecific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347AI\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3aAI\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "result": "\u4e3aAI\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4fdd\u969c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u672a\u6765\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6709\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u52a8AI\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Our encoder\nprocesses input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is\ndevised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,\nthe decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the\nreconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded\ncounterpart xLSTMAD-R.

In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework\nfrom an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model\ninterpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\\ell_0$-norm\ninduced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we\nreformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization\nproblem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a\nsubspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the\nsearch space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated\nspatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying\nsparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by\ndeveloping a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme\nmakes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision\nvariables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the\nproposed models on real-world time series data.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers.

Traditional\nquanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely\nbeen static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our\nresearch overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,\nsignificantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the\nintroduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities\nin gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing\ngradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel\narchitecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging\nthe concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by\nadding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between\nquanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the\nnetwork, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide\nempirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within\nQuNNs.

To address this, this paper introduces a\nfeature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by\nredistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To\nassess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained\nusing cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,\nincluding disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a\nstandard measure of predictive performance.

At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We\ndemonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds\ndistributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These\nemergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value\nmechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture\nprovides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can\nemerge from local neural learning.

Along with a sampling strategy adopted\nfrom image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks\nfirst in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with\nother probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while\nenjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score\n(CRPS).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDouble-Diffusion\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDouble-Diffusion\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1130%-50%\uff0cCRPS\u63d0\u53473%-12%\u3002", "conclusion": "Double-Diffusion\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is\noften the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow\nobservational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world\nmodel, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very\nobserved causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Meta-Causal\nGraph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently\nencodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across\ndifferent latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of\nmultiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent\nstate space. Building on this representation, we introduce a\n\\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta\nstates that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal\nrelationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)\niteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven\nexploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a\nchallenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly\ncaptures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously\nunseen contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u5143\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u201d\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u5e38\u56e0\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a97\u53e3\u72ed\u7a84\u800c\u663e\u5f97\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u6613\u53d7\u7b56\u7565\u6216\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u7531\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u81c2\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u6355\u6349\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5143\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Motivated by this finding\nand our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the\nratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training\ncomponent. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs\ncircumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is\nconsistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those\nwhere they do not.

This\nallows it to distinguish between coherent and conflicting gradient directions,\nincreasing the learning rate when updates align and reducing it in regions of\noscillation or noise. The result is a more responsive optimizer that\naccelerates convergence in smooth regions of the loss surface while maintaining\nstability in sharper or more erratic areas.

Current deep\nlearning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by\n\\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \\emph{e.g.}, by\nminimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been\nproven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.\nHowever, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real\nworld, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the\nBayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a\nnovel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of\nthe data distributions by \\emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the\nposterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,\nour method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based\non Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and\nensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a\nstraightforward yet effective \\emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This\nmethod enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set\nto effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance\nfactor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional\ncomputational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are\northogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they\nare mostly designed under the principle of \\emph{implicitly} estimating the\nposterior probabilities.

However, the reasoning and inner workings of today's\ncomplex AI models are not transparent to the user, and there are no safety\nguarantees regarding their predictions. Consequently, to fulfill the promise of\nAI, we must address the following scientific challenge: how to develop AI-based\nsystems that are not only accurate and performant but also safe and\ntrustworthy?\n  The criticality of safe operation is particularly evident for autonomous\nsystems for control and robotics, and was the catalyst for the Safe Learning\nEnabled Systems (SLES) program at NSF. For the broader class of AI\napplications, such as users interacting with chatbots and clinicians receiving\ntreatment recommendations, safety is, while no less important, less\nwell-defined with context-dependent interpretations.

Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that\nrepresents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face\nlimitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,\nand stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing\nthese challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree\nbranch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical\nrelationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based\napproach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a\nhierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized\ndiffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves\nstability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative\ncapacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion\nprocess.

To\nextract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for\nclass-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level\ntraffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,\nwe formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic\nnetwork states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times\nfrom local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To\nassess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a\nseries of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The\nresults of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data\nwith satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,\nespecially for links without local sensors.

Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs\nshow that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive\nresults with reasoning-optimized models.

Recent progress in hate speech detection is\ntypically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource\nlanguages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,\nhigh-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this\nlimitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on\nlow-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -\nzero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot\nprompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to\ndetect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the\nmetaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that\nmarks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical.

Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those\ngenerating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for\nunifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching\n(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies\nand advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM\ndecomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing\nfor expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary\nnon-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design\navenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference\nTransition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by\ndirectly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image\nquality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)\nAutoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition\nMatching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that\ngeneralize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation\nquality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless\nintegration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the\nfirst fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based\nmethods on text-to-image task in continuous domains.

We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a\nmajority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or\nnormative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we\nfind that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often\nconflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of\nqueerness and thus improper quantifications of bias.

To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process\nexecutions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable\nprocess model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning\ntraces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process\nmodels. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process\nmodel discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or\nprobability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to\ncapture real-world execution dynamics.

Experimental results\nfrom three cities demonstrate that $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms\nopen-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex\ncross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.\nSource codes and data are openly accessible to the research community via\nhttps://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanLLaVA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bUrbanLLaVA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u57ce\u5e02\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57ce\u5e02\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUrbanLLaVA\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709MLLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UrbanLLaVA\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing online repair solutions\nenforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into\nacceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based\nconstraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack\ngeneralizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in\nineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently\nbut also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we\npropose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method\nthat identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed\ntests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.\nSpecifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint\nheads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving\nenvironment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate\nadaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety\nidentification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse\nannotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and\nothers as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to\nmitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat\nconservative mitigation strategies.

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view\nfrom the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free\nmatching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without\nrelying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,\nwe introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility\nprior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with\nlow intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input.

A Critical Look at Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV"], "comment": "Github link: https://github.com/TomSheng21/tta-vlm", "summary": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for\nenhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during\ninference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA\nresearches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of\nbaseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental\nsettings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons\nbetween TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7\nonline TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates\nthem across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on\nCLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid\nloss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA\nto assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates\nvarious evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,\nout-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic\nassessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)\nexisting TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering\nwork; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time\nfine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced\nmodel trustworthiness.

Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97%\nof the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These\nmodels are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling\napplications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and\nlow-resource environments.

We explore\nthe sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h\nPangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a\nspecific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV)\nmethod does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to\nnumerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth\nwithin a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast\nmodel to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly\nbased on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each\niteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are\nexpected to turn into directions of growing errors.

Existing learning-based approaches often rely on\ndiscretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to\ninefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we\nformalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes\nto prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can\nbe equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The\ncore idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial\nGroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally\napproximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we\ndevelop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous\nsampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order\noptimization.

In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster.

There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,\nalthough there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.\nConclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from\nconcatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method\nhas short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being\navailable within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging\nsuggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical\npractice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5c062D\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u7531\u547c\u5438\u7535\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a3D\u7535\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfCMR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u78c1\u5171\u632f\uff08CMR\uff09\u5728\u513f\u79d1\u548c\u5148\u5929\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u75282D\u547c\u5438\u95e8\u63a7\u7535\u5f71\u6210\u50cf\u548c3D\u9759\u6001\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8017\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u62103D\u7535\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u3002\u572810\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a3D\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4<1\u5206\u949f\u3002\u5fc3\u5ba4\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8840\u7ba1\u76f4\u5f84\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ec5\u53f3\u80ba\u52a8\u8109\u76f4\u5f84\u7565\u6709\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u62103D\u7535\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6210\u50cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8aCMR\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

A skillful climate model should capture both stationary\nstatistics and responses to external perturbations. While current\nautoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically\nstruggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical\nsystem to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models\nunder two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another\nwith only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,\nthe models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses\nin ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial\nobservations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \\textit{proper}\nvariables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees\nof freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect\nfundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow\ndynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as\ncoarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both\nconceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems\nlike the coupled climate system.

The choice of data encoding\nscheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient.

Representing users and items\nas low-dimensional embeddings learned via neural networks has become a leading\nsolution.

The model employs state-of-the-art strategies\nthat natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training\nphase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted\nregarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we\nbenchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a\ntop-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms.\nThe model achieved the second or third-best results in 30\\% of the datasets,\nbeing competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient\nwith an average training time reduction of 274\\% compared to other\nembedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the\nembeddings through similarity tables.

We first uncover a dynamic period\nin which leading venues increasingly prioritized cutting-edge deep learning\ndevelopments that displaced relatively traditional statistical learning\nmethods. Scientists responded to these changes in markedly different ways.\nThose who were previously successful or affiliated with old teams adapted more\nslowly, experiencing what we term a rigidity penalty - a reluctance to embrace\nnew directions leading to a decline in scientific impact, as measured by\ncitation percentile rank. In contrast, scientists who pursued strategic\nadaptation - selectively pivoting toward emerging trends while preserving weak\nconnections to prior expertise - reaped the greatest benefits. Taken together,\nour macro- and micro-level findings show that scientific breakthroughs act as\nmechanisms that reconfigure power structures within a field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u575a\u6301\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u65f6\u671f\u575a\u6301\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee52012\u5e74AlexNet\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9769\u547d\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e865000\u591a\u540d\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u575a\u6301\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u67905000\u591a\u540d\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9769\u547d\u524d\u540e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7126\u70b9\u548c\u4ea7\u51fa\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u575a\u6301\u65e7\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u9762\u4e34\u2018\u521a\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u2019\uff0c\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u83b7\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u5b66\u7a81\u7834\u4f1a\u91cd\u6784\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u6743\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,\ninference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the\napplicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,\nand 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and\nmorphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed\nframework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal\ncomputational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08NCA\uff09\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6e05\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "NCA\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5267\u589e\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6e05\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86NCA\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with\nspecific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their\ngeneralizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more\nchallenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate\nsets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user\ninstructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce\n$\\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,\nproviding comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we\npropose $\\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user\ninstructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective\nevaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and\ngenerated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free\nframework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'\nin-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both\nimage-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive\nexperiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all\nexisting methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current\ngeneralized and even specialized approaches.

Existing methods rely on\nhandcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be\nconfounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel\nattacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the\ncausal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model\nattribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific\nartifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the\nresulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned\nattention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation\npatterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.\nExtensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show\nthat with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves\nstate-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel\nattacks.

Existing attempts to accelerate\nINR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level\ncontrol essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD\n(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that\nfundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises.

This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding\nspeed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while\nmaintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.\nCritically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous\nresolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding.

However, previous work has shown that\nusers' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,\nallocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual\nor image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect\nattention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when\nscrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a\nfixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been\naddressed by existing LTR methods.\n  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking\ntask, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation\nlength is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show\nthat this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability\nranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem\ncannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.\n  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient\nestimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.\nOur semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the\nexpected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best\nperformance across different ranking settings.

The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image\nby leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both\nimages captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,\ni.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image\ninpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content\ndistinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such\nan application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image\nby referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the\nreference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to\nachieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address\nsuch an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution\nTransition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the\ntime-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of\ndamaged regions.

However,\nlarge-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and\nweb-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels\nfrom both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The model incorporates\nseveral key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset\nof 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI\nscreenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop\nenvironments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial\ncross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by\nspecialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model\nadaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,\ndemonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy\nachieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity\nover sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding\nbenchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging\nScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%\non ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B\nparameters.

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase\nthat MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency.

However,\nmost current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,\nassuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded\nenvironments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to\nkeep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must\ncontinuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process\nand adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing\ndataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of\nescorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where\nother individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to\nidentify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting\ntheir actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification\nand action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network\narchitecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust\nits speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume\nescorting after any disruption.

However, with\nmore bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to\nthe point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on\nthe insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra\nbits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit\nallocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise\nallocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and\naccuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and\nthe bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable\nthrough gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue.

However,\nmost existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity\nVision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across\nmodalities.

In this paper, we propose\nan efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity\nVision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a\nlightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each\nmodality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate\nmodality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the\nmodality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based\nFEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,\ncross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused\nrepresentations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target\nlocalization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking\nbenchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,\nFE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the\nproposed tracking framework.

Each worker\nrequires at most $h$ seconds to compute a stochastic gradient, and the\ncommunication times from the server to the workers and from the workers to the\nserver are $\\tau_{s}$ and $\\tau_{w}$ seconds per coordinate, respectively. One\nof the main motivations for distributed optimization is to achieve scalability\nwith respect to $n$. For instance, it is well known that the distributed\nversion of SGD has a variance-dependent runtime term $\\frac{h \\sigma^2 L\n\\Delta}{n \\varepsilon^2},$ which improves with the number of workers $n,$ where\n$\\Delta = f(x^0) - f^*,$ and $x^0 \\in R^d$ is the starting point. Similarly,\nusing unbiased sparsification compressors, it is possible to reduce both the\nvariance-dependent runtime term and the communication runtime term.

However, their proficiency in these high-level applications\noften assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a\ncapability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions\nreliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,\nweight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical\nconstraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being\nclosed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue\nthat off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded\nunderstanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.\n  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of\ncore Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability\nperspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,\ncomprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1\nto 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,\nand 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.\n  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to\ngrasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their\nsuitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for\ntargeted research.

In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the\nprimary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does\nnot provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which\nprevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here\nwe focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving\nthe underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model\nparameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool\nto demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data\ndoes not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush\nmodel parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence\nof images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high\nimpact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of\ncompaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine\nlearning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical\nparameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\napproach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact\nexperiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model\nparameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and\nphysically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the\nrobustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned\napproach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of\nout-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby\npromoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from\nexperimental radiographic images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u51b2\u51fb\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6750\u6599\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5b54\u9699\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u53d6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u51b2\u51fb\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6210\u50cf\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u4f4e\u51b2\u51fb\u901f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceX\u5c04\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6750\u6599\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Formalizing such rules as logic\nconstraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the\nbrittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic\nunderstanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of\nreach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches\nyield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.\n  This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and\nintroduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from\nraw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely\nchallenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and\npassive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos\naddresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint\nspecificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from\nsuperquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial\nsearch space.\n  Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all\nbenchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data\npoints, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than\n25% of the rules and require several days to run.

Prior works related\nto cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without\nloss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these\ngaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend\nthe latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy\ngenerated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes\nthe real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept\nwith the object specified by the text in a disentangled way.

However, its potential in the more challenging\ndata-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the\nconcept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level\nskip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information\nvanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge\nthrough pixel space optimization and existing core local information\nidentification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset\ndistillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level\nrefinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,\nachieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory\nusage by 50%.
