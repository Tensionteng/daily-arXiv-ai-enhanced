### [1] [DiMo-GUI: Advancing Test-time Scaling in GUI Grounding via Modality-Aware Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00008)
*Hang Wu,Hongkai Chen,Yujun Cai,Chang Liu,Qingwen Ye,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiMo-GUI是一个无需训练的GUI自然语言查询框架，通过动态视觉定位和模态感知优化解决GUI中的视觉元素多样性和语言歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GUI中视觉元素多样性和语言歧义带来的挑战。

Method: 将GUI拆分为文本和图标元素，利用通用视觉语言模型独立处理模态，并通过动态聚焦和分层细化优化定位结果。

Result: 在标准GUI基准测试中表现优于基线方法，验证了模态分离与区域聚焦推理的有效性。

Conclusion: DiMo-GUI通过动态视觉定位和模态感知优化，无需额外训练即可显著提升GUI定位性能。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses
unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and
the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a
training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:
dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating
the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual
elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality
independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions
are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by
generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions
and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This
hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts
without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our
approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness
of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

### [2] [TalentMine: LLM-Based Extraction and Question-Answering from Multimodal Talent Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00041)
*Varun Mannam,Fang Wang,Chaochun Liu,Xin Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出TalentMine框架，通过增强语义理解解决表格信息检索问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格提取方法在语义理解上表现不佳，导致信息检索和决策支持失败。

Method: 引入TalentMine框架，结合多模态推理生成语义丰富的表格表示。

Result: 实验显示TalentMine在查询任务中达到100%准确率，远超现有方法。

Conclusion: TalentMine有效解决语义信息丢失问题，为人才管理提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex
tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional
language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent
documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for
accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table
extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor
performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This
paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be
extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,
causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a
novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically
enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text
linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve
both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental
evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates
TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering
tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS
Textract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that
the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management
applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic
analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,
(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,
(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as
end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks
showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

### [3] [A collaborative digital twin built on FAIR data and compute infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00048)
*Thomas M. Deucher,Juan C. Verduzco,Michael Titus,Alejandro Strachan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于FAIR数据基础设施的分布式自驱动实验室（SDL）框架，用于加速科学和工程中的发现与优化任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过整合机器学习和自动化实验，利用FAIR数据基础设施促进协作，提高实验效率和资源共享。

Method: 采用nanoHUB服务实现在线模拟和FAIR数据管理，通过共享数据库和主动学习优化实验设计。

Result: 开发了一个可扩展的工具框架，支持多地点协作和数据驱动的优化任务。

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，可扩展到其他优化问题，为科学和工程研究提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in
self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate
discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When
supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data
infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more
effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on
nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this
framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent
optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central
database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine
learning models that automatically update as additional data become available.
New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically
processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes
all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate
nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where
researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are
trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future
experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task
seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired
target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and
students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and
explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential
optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be
extended to other optimization problems.

### [4] [SEZ-HARN: Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00050)
*Devin Y. De Silva,Sandareka Wickramanayake,Dulani Meedeniya,Sanka Rasnayaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEZ-HARN是一种新型的零样本人类活动识别模型，能够识别未训练过的活动并提供解释性骨架视频，性能接近黑盒模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本HAR模型缺乏透明性和数据不足的问题。

Method: 提出自解释零样本HAR网络（SEZ-HARN），结合骨架视频解释决策过程。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现接近最佳黑盒模型，同时提供可理解的解释。

Conclusion: SEZ-HARN在保持高精度的同时提高了模型透明度。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted
living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited
by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of
activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR
(ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain
their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel
IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity
Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered
during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making
process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four
benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its
performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The
experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and
understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition
accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the
best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable
performance on the other three datasets.

### [5] [Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities in SLMs with Reward Guided Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00054)
*Shreyansh Padarha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvDistill提出了一种基于奖励的数据集蒸馏框架，通过多代教师模型响应和规则验证器分配奖励权重，显著提升了学生模型在数学和复杂推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏技术中学生模型仅模仿教师模型的分布内响应，限制了泛化能力，尤其在推理任务中表现不足且计算成本高。

Method: AdvDistill利用教师模型对每个提示生成多个响应，并通过规则验证器分配奖励权重，训练学生模型时使用这些权重。

Result: 实验表明，AdvDistill显著提升了学生模型在数学和复杂推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 引入奖励机制的数据集蒸馏方法有效提升了学生模型的泛化能力和任务表现。

Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has
benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These
techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and
larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around
the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses,
limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks
and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a
reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations
(responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on
rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as
weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent
behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model
performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the
efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset
distillation processes.

### [6] [VoyagerVision: Investigating the Role of Multi-modal Information for Open-ended Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00079)
*Ethan Smyth,Alessandro Suglia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出VoyagerVision，一种多模态模型，通过视觉反馈扩展了Voyager的能力，使其能在Minecraft中构建结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过视觉输入增强模型的开放性和任务执行能力，特别是在空间环境理解方面。

Method: 提出VoyagerVision，利用截图作为视觉反馈，结合LLMs的多模态能力，在Minecraft中构建结构。

Result: VoyagerVision在50次迭代中平均构建2.75个独特结构，且在平坦世界中成功率为50%。

Conclusion: 视觉输入显著提升了模型的开放性和任务多样性，为AGI研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their
own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of
interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use
of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse
the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing
these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial
environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully
perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes
VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within
Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the
foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75
unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was
incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction.
Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in
half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex
structures. Project website is available at

### [7] [Thinking About Thinking: SAGE-nano's Inverse Reasoning for Self-Aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00092)
*Basab Jha,Firoj Paudel,Ujjwal Puri,Zhang Yuting,Choi Donghyuk,Wang Junhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“逆向推理”的新范式，通过SAGE-nano模型实现LLM的自我解释，提升推理透明度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在推理过程中决策过程不透明的问题，增强其解释性和可理解性。

Method: 采用逆向推理和元认知结构，通过注意力机制反向分析推理链，生成解释。

Result: SAGE-nano在AQUA-RAT等测试中达到74.6%的推理准确率和92.1%的人类偏好评分，性能接近GPT-4o等模型。

Conclusion: 逆向推理框架显著提升了LLM的透明度和推理能力，为AI安全、教育和科学发现开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at
solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but
their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce
textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and
explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a
4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that
reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and
generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are
directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides
insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through
thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical
dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we
demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy
(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for
its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5
Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for
LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework
to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for
reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using
inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.
Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant
gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

### [8] [BlackBoxToBlueprint: Extracting Interpretable Logic from Legacy Systems using Reinforcement Learning and Counterfactual Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00180)
*Vidhi Rathore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过强化学习从遗留系统中提取可解释的决策逻辑，并用决策树生成人类可读的规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅复制输入输出行为，无法捕捉底层意图，而遗留系统缺乏文档和理解。

Method: 使用强化学习代理探索输入空间，识别关键决策边界，并通过K-Means聚类和决策树提取规则。

Result: 在三种不同复杂度的遗留系统上验证，提取的规则准确反映了核心逻辑。

Conclusion: 该方法为遗留系统迁移提供了生成规范和测试用例的有希望的基础。

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often
hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's
intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely
replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This
paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision
logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify
critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes
in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the
output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are
then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate
the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the
pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,
including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.
Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant
boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of
the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating
specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

### [9] [ChatGPT produces more "lazy" thinkers: Evidence of cognitive engagement decline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00181)
*Georgios P. Georgiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，使用ChatGPT等AI工具辅助学术写作会显著降低学生的认知投入，可能导致认知卸载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI工具（如ChatGPT）对学生学术写作任务中认知投入的影响。

Method: 采用实验设计，将参与者随机分配到AI辅助（ChatGPT）或非辅助（对照组）条件，通过认知投入量表（CES-AI）评估。

Result: ChatGPT组的认知投入得分显著低于对照组。

Conclusion: AI辅助可能导致认知卸载，需结合教学策略以促进学生主动反思，避免影响自我调节学习和深度认知投入。

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education,
concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active
learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of
students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental
design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT)
or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured
argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the
CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and
strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive
engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These
findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study
contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications
of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such
tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote
active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising
self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.

TL;DR: xHAIM是一个基于生成式AI的框架，通过任务相关数据识别、患者摘要生成、预测建模和临床解释，提升了医学AI的可解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HAIM框架在任务无关性和缺乏可解释性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过四个步骤：任务相关数据识别、患者摘要生成、预测建模和临床解释。

Result: 在HAIM-MIMIC-MM数据集上，AUC从79.9%提升至90.3%。

Conclusion: xHAIM将AI从黑盒预测器转变为可解释的决策支持系统，增强了临床实用性。

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in
medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework
that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM
uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these
limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework
leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through
four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data
across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using
these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical
explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge.
Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9%
to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM
transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support
system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant
patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

TL;DR: 综述了机器学习在解决NP难组合优化问题（如TSP和VRP）中的应用进展，提出了一种分类方法，并探讨了与传统运筹学方法的结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于NP难问题的复杂性，传统算法效率低或无法保证最优解，机器学习为这些问题的解决提供了新思路。

Method: 提出了一种分类法，将基于机器学习的方法分为构造型和改进型，并分析了其适用性。

Result: 综述了机器学习在路由问题中的应用，为未来研究提供了结构化框架。

Conclusion: 机器学习与传统运筹学方法的结合为解决新兴VRP变体提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML)
tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on
routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle
routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact
algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal
solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without
guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models,
there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to
enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a
taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and
improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various
problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods
with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide
future research and address emerging VRP variants.

*Joongwon Kim,Anirudh Goyal,Liang Tan,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Srinivasan Iyer,Tianlu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASTRO框架通过自回归搜索训练语言模型，利用自我反思、回溯和探索行为，显著提升了非推理模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升非推理模型（如Llama 3）的推理能力，通过结构化搜索行为训练。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）生成合成数据集，将搜索轨迹转化为自然语言链式思维，并通过强化学习进一步优化。

Result: 在MATH-500、AMC 2023和AIME 2024上分别取得16.0%、26.9%和20.0%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 搜索启发的训练方法为开放LLM提供了稳健的推理能力提升途径。

Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework
for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly
leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs.
Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL)
has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning
capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,
build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with
search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to
boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama
3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through
a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over
mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into
natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries
from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during
RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve
performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3
family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,
26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon
challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate
that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust
reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了数学推理能力在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的表现是否具有广泛的问题解决能力，发现大多数数学表现优异的模型在其他领域表现不佳。通过实验发现，强化学习（RL）调优的模型具有更好的泛化能力，而监督微调（SFT）调优的模型容易遗忘通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨数学推理能力的提升是否反映了LLMs的广泛问题解决能力，还是仅仅是对特定任务的过拟合。

Method: 评估了20多个开源推理调优模型在数学、科学问答、代理规划、编码和指令遵循等任务上的表现，并对Qwen3-14B模型进行了数学数据调优的对比实验。

Result: 大多数数学表现优异的模型在其他领域表现不佳，RL调优的模型泛化能力更强，而SFT调优的模型容易遗忘通用能力。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考后训练方法，尤其是依赖SFT蒸馏数据提升推理模型的局限性。

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language
models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on
benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,
it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or
just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20
open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including
math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard
instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in
math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this
phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using
math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement
learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised
fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space
representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT
induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves
general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard
post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for
advancing reasoning models.

of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a
two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the
key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we
propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the
local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing
satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To
further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed
technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is
well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search
away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA
combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through
information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in
local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过强化学习（RL）训练大型语言模型（LLMs）在象棋中发展策略推理能力的效果，发现基于知识蒸馏的密集奖励优于稀疏奖励，但模型表现仍远低于专家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在策略推理任务（如象棋）中通过RL训练的能力，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 利用预训练的象棋动作价值网络为LLM的输出提供密集奖励（知识蒸馏），并与稀疏奖励对比。

Result: 密集奖励通常优于稀疏奖励，但所有模型表现远低于专家水平，表明预训练模型对象棋的理解存在缺陷。

Conclusion: RL训练可能无法完全弥补预训练模型在象棋理解上的缺陷，需进一步研究。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown
promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL
remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic
reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a
chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's
output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our
experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform
sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below
expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and
find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained
models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be
able to fully overcome.

Motivation: 随着多模态基础模型在智能代理系统中的广泛应用，系统面临越狱风险，现有安全措施在复杂交互中表现不足，缺乏高效的风险评估方法。

Result: 初步验证表明，该方法能提高风险行为识别率，降低代理被越狱的概率。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态智能代理系统的安全风险建模与防护提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent
agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant
interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large
model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed
to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the
original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger
certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing
unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new
challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent
agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in
detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations
or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated
methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is
currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile
multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by
incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated
assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary
validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the
method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist
in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study
can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and
protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索机器实现通用人工智能（AGI）的可能性，尽管现有模型（如GPT-4.5、DeepSeek等）在多模态和部分推理方面表现出色，但仍受限于基于令牌的预测和缺乏实际代理能力。

Method: 通过跨学科综合（AI、认知神经科学、心理学等），分析了通用智能的架构和认知基础，提出了Agentic RAG框架、信息压缩等策略，并讨论了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的潜在作用。

Result: 研究指出，真正的智能需要整合记忆与推理，而不仅仅是规模扩展。神经符号系统、强化学习等技术的进步为缩小统计学习与目标导向认知之间的差距提供了可能。

Conclusion: 结论强调，实现AGI需要解决科学、技术和伦理上的关键挑战，并提出了模块化、交互式和自我改进的组件集成是实现自适应行为的关键。

Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This
enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5,
DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal
fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by
their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This
paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning
artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models,
and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations
of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent
memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of
Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use
to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies,
including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free
methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but
as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task
completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone
but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular,
interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive
behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning,
and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge
the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we
identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to
demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and
reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this
work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence
diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent
decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect
relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer
decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID
based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)
guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)
iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in
both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Motivation: LLMs在表现卓越的同时存在信息扩散问题，传统方法将其视为计算精度问题，而本文将其重新定义为信息论通信问题。

Method: 引入HDRAM框架，将Transformer潜在空间视为扩频信道，结合纠错码、全息计算和量子启发搜索，通过相位相干内存地址实现高效操作。

Result: HDRAM显著提升了关联检索能力，无需架构改动，展示了经典-全息-量子启发（CHQ）原则的潜力。

Conclusion: HDRAM为LLMs提供了一种新的信息处理范式，证明了CHQ原则在强化Transformer架构中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from
apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing
shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic
communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by
introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic
memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum
channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating
classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and
quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through
principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient
key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC
grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM
significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes,
demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can
fortify transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物联网环境中入侵检测的不确定性问题和可解释性需求，提升边缘部署中的信任度。

Method: 结合随机森林、XGBoost和逻辑回归，利用中性逻辑分解预测置信度，并设置全局和类别特定阈值进行审慎标记。

Result: 在IoT-CAD数据集上达到97%准确率，误分类样本的不确定性显著高于正确分类样本。

Conclusion: 中性逻辑提升了准确性和可解释性，为边缘物联网安全系统提供了信任感知的AI基础。

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework
for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating
Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the
system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and
indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and
abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using
both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD
dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that
misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62)
than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for
uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly
valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation
between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy,
human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic
enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for
trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

Result: 理论分析揭示了线性精度与对数计算的关系，以及任务难度和模型能力对推理策略的影响。

Conclusion: DS3框架深化了对训练与推理相互依赖的理解，支持算法设计和资源分配的优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and
financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for
training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now
represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden,
particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of
compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens
in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating
points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general
framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned
skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive
closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range
of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought
(ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and
model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite
graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge
DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We
theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy
scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies
as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior
elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;
and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified
analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference
interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports
principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的电梯群控系统在效率和适应性上优于传统方法，为大型建筑的电梯管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for
minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or
pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and
combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor
system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train
an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS).
Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the
combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of
infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward
signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to
adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL
architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the
proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a
highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based
algorithm.

Method: 提出CMIM方法，联合最小化交叉熵损失和温度缩放后的CMI值，使输出概率分布高度集中。

Result: CMIM模型在所有测试的知识蒸馏方法下均不可蒸馏，且其自身预测性能优于仅使用交叉熵损失的模型。

Conclusion: CMIM方法有效构建了不可蒸馏的DNN，同时提升了模型自身的性能。

Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a
black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge
distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the
knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with
label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect
intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To
this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait
that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all
sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the
extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse
into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring
the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information
(CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed,
which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE)
loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire
temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive
experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the
literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from
the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM
model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss
alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: ST-MTM通过分解和针对性掩码策略有效捕捉时间序列的语义信息，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that
involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling
has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by
reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic
information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations
generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series
ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious
temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal
semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled
patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a
masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which
includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that
incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a
period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked
seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking
strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar
variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task
for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,
ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by
enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal
representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves
consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked
modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol
comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python

Result: 实验证明该方法在白盒攻击场景中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: AdvI令牌在ViT中有效检测对抗攻击，简化系统架构并提升防御性能。

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural
language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their
applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in
the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has
been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is
susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this
issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation
classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new
concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial
attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an
AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an
adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we
combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural
network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to
detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into
the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.
We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,
influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in
the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through
experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several
competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those
utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and
basic iterative method.

Result: GRFT在FGVC和VTAB数据集上仅需更新1.22%和0.30%的参数，性能优于GPS、Adapter Tuning和LoRA。

Conclusion: GRFT高效且有效，显著减少资源需求并提升性能，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across
various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks
demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning
method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only
the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number
of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational
resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an
efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates
the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the
rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for
updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the
efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization
to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter
Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the
total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its
high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

Result: 提出的方法在指令跟随任务中实现了高达25%的相对增益和6%的绝对胜率提升。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了LLM的理论基础，为后训练优化提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained
language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or
preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a
unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through
rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference
learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the
same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of
implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in
conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes
constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain
model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate
reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to
\textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in
instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives
from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during
optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend
the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference
learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and
experimental validation.

TL;DR: 本文提出并比较了三种量子启发的数据编码策略（ILS、GDS、CCVS），旨在减少编码时间并分析其对分类性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是优化量子启发的数据转换，以用于经典机器学习模型，同时减少高编码时间并确保编码正确性。

Method: 提出了三种编码策略：ILS（独立处理每行数据）、GDS（全局统一映射特征值）和CCVS（按类别分别编码）。这些策略被应用于分类任务，评估其对编码效率、正确性、模型准确性和计算成本的影响。

Result: 通过分析编码时间、精度和预测性能之间的权衡，研究为优化量子启发的数据转换提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究为经典机器学习工作流中的量子启发数据转换提供了优化方向，并展示了不同策略的优缺点。

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data
encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy
(GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical
data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The
primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct
encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The
Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local
quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique
feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In
contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique
values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their
impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational
cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and
predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum
inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

TL;DR: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）改进马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（McMC）方法，生成更广泛的先验提案，提升效率和适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如KLE）需要已知协方差函数，而实际应用中往往缺乏此类信息。VAE提供数据驱动的方法，灵活捕捉更广泛的相关结构。

Method: 采用VAE框架，应用于地下水流反演问题，通过压力数据估计渗透率场。

Result: VAE在已知相关长度时与KLE精度相当，在相关长度假设偏离真实值时优于KLE，并显著降低随机维度，提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 深度生成模型在McMC方法中的应用可提升高维贝叶斯推断的适应性和效率。

Abstract: This study uses a Variational Autoencoder method to enhance the efficiency
and applicability of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by generating
broader-spectrum prior proposals. Traditional approaches, such as the
Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE), require previous knowledge of the covariance
function, often unavailable in practical applications. The VAE framework
enables a data-driven approach to flexibly capture a broader range of
correlation structures in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly subsurface
flow modeling. The methodology is tested on a synthetic groundwater flow
inversion problem, where pressure data is used to estimate permeability fields.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the VAE-based parameterization achieves
comparable accuracy to KLE when the correlation length is known and outperforms
KLE when the assumed correlation length deviates from the true value. Moreover,
the VAE approach significantly reduces stochastic dimensionality, improving
computational efficiency. The results suggest that leveraging deep generative
models in McMC methods can lead to more adaptable and efficient Bayesian
inference in high-dimensional problems.

Conclusion: AIMatDesign框架展示了在闭环材料发现中的可靠性和潜力，为高维材料设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse
design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional
materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches
suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack
reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the
design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert
knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design.
To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning
framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data
using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool,
accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated
refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects
prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and
state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function
leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during
training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses
traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery
efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates
proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based
alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\%
elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately
captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating
its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在特定领域内预测可靠性和泛化到未见系统方面存在局限。

Method: FNSDA通过傅里叶模式自动分区识别共享动态，并基于低维潜在系统参数调整模式以实现高效泛化。

Result: 在四种动态系统上的实验表明，FNSDA在泛化性能上优于或与现有方法相当，且参数成本显著降低。

Conclusion: FNSDA是一种高效且泛化能力强的动态系统建模方法。

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has
shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics.
However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable
predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen
systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in
environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient
method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can
readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space.
Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known
environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust
the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional
latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our
approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results
show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance
compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost. Our
code is available at https://github.com/WonderSeven/FNSDA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ROSE的新框架，通过多目标强化学习生成多样化和上下文丰富的对抗性提示，以更有效地评估大型语言模型的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在现实应用中的广泛部署，评估其安全性（尤其是在对抗性提示下）变得至关重要。现有的人工安全基准因静态性和更新成本高而难以适应快速发展的LLMs。

Method: 提出ROSE框架，利用多目标强化学习微调对抗性LLM，生成多样化和上下文丰富的对抗性提示。

Result: 实验表明，ROSE在揭示最先进LLMs的安全漏洞方面优于现有方法，综合评估指标显著提升。

Conclusion: ROSE为更实用和面向现实的LLMs安全评估迈出了一步。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box
components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under
adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety
evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover
a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose
potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on
handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the
intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with
rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation
offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods
often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level
diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem
from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack
of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both
topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose
Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses
multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for
generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.
Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety
vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in
integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more
practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper
contains examples of potentially harmful text.

Result: 在多数据集上的实验表明，HiT-JEPA的分层设计能生成更丰富的多尺度表示。

Conclusion: HiT-JEPA通过分层设计有效解决了轨迹表示的多尺度问题，为轨迹分析提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in
effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress,
the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse
and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing
methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and
high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both
long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we
propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning
multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction
levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures
point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level
trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics
and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that
HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结合LoRA和MoE时存在参数效率低和任务保真度不足的问题，需要一种更高效且兼容性强的解决方案。

Method: LoRA-Mixer通过替换注意力模块的输入/输出线性层的投影矩阵为动态路由的LoRA专家，支持联合优化或直接部署预训练模块，并引入自适应SBL损失优化路由。

Result: 在多个数据集（如GSM8K、HumanEval、MedQA）上，LoRA-Mixer显著优于基准模型和现有方法，同时仅使用48%的参数。

Conclusion: LoRA-Mixer是一个高效且性能优越的框架，适用于多种基础模型，显著提升了任务适应性和参数效率。

Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit
prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers
for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter
efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and
lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation
lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's
input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts.
This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models,
including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their
inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational
paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a
novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained,
frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router
training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and
maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss
(SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment.
Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA,
SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of
LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer
achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base
models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer
achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively,
using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong
performance.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in complex
sequential decision-making tasks, such as playing Atari 2600 games and
mastering board games. A critical yet underexplored aspect of DRL is the
temporal scale of action execution. We propose a novel paradigm that integrates
contextual bandits with DRL to adaptively select action durations, enhancing
policy flexibility and computational efficiency. Our approach augments a Deep
Q-Network (DQN) with a contextual bandit module that learns to choose optimal
action repetition rates based on state contexts. Experiments on Atari 2600
games demonstrate significant performance improvements over static duration
baselines, highlighting the efficacy of adaptive temporal abstractions in DRL.
This paradigm offers a scalable solution for real-time applications like gaming
and robotics, where dynamic action durations are critical.

Result: SPN显著提升了预测性能，测试MSE最高降低了9.85%。

Conclusion: 空间平滑稀疏流动性信号是一种简单而有效的方法，可提升公共卫生危机期间的时空预测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of human mobility is critical for understanding epidemic
spread and deploying timely interventions. In this work, we leverage a
large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital
Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast
mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial
sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits
the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we
propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN)
technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its
immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting
backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input
lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting
performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings
demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple
yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public
health crises.

Conclusion: 研究为后续的迁移学习策略、不确定性量化和设计优化奠定了基础，强调了需要显式纳入轴向功率分布的模型。

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the onset of boiling crisis in light-water
reactors, defining safe thermal-hydraulic operating limits. To support Phase II
of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power
profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both
uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were
extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh,
validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats
for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating
and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular
methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network
trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to
generalize to spatially varying scenarios, underscoring the need for models
that explicitly incorporate axial power distributions. By providing these
curated datasets and baseline modeling results, this study lays the groundwork
for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification,
and design-optimization efforts in the next phase of the CHF benchmark.

Conclusion: IDRIFTNET能有效捕捉冰山漂移的复杂非线性动态，为有限数据条件下的轨迹预测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Drifting icebergs in the polar oceans play a key role in the Earth's climate
system, impacting freshwater fluxes into the ocean and regional ecosystems
while also posing a challenge to polar navigation. However, accurately
forecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due
to the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of
iceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg
motion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a
highly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These
limitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture
the underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address
these challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep
learning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift
physics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the
pattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth
observations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network
that captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future
iceberg drift positions. We compare IDRIFTNET model performance with
state-of-the-art models on two Antarctic icebergs: A23A and B22A. Our findings
demonstrate that IDRIFTNET outperforms other models by achieving a lower Final
Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across a variety
of time points. These results highlight IDRIFTNET's effectiveness in capturing
the complex, nonlinear drift of icebergs for forecasting iceberg trajectories
under limited data and dynamic environmental conditions.

Motivation: 模型融合的目标是结合多个模型的知识，但由于内部表示的差异（如排列不变性、随机初始化或数据分布不同），这一过程具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种神经元中心的融合算法，通过分组父模型的中间神经元并利用神经元属性评分，生成目标表示，再由融合模型近似其子网络。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在多种基准数据集上优于现有融合技术，尤其在零样本和非独立同分布场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该算法提供了一种通用的模型融合方法，适用于任意层类型，代码已开源。

Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one
representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents.
However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal
representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random
initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel,
neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple
trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of
training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent
models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with
its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach
incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore,
our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently
outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID
fusion scenarios. The code is available at

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most
informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training
efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal
instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy
based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty
using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach.
Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the
classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we
use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances
sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy
gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective
data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset
could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we
have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English
datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable
insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training. The codes are

Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and
attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network
analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task,
those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the
patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify
meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a
function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the
literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the
most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to
provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically
focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most
widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we
present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We
characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We
leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a
method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these
resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of
pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a
clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the
same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to
be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that
some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the
best results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LiSER的轻量级语音情感识别框架，通过知识蒸馏利用未标记的视听数据，减少对大量标记数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别（SER）在人机交互系统中至关重要，但收集大量标记数据成本高昂。多模态（音频-视觉）数据能提升SER性能，但缺乏标记数据限制了其发展。

Method: 提出LiSER框架，利用大型教师模型（基于先进的语音和面部表示模型）从未标记的视听数据中提取知识，并将其传递给轻量级学生模型。

Result: 在RAVDESS和CREMA-D两个基准数据集上的实验表明，LiSER能显著减少对标记数据的需求。

Conclusion: LiSER为语音情感识别提供了一种高效且低成本的方法，通过知识蒸馏利用未标记数据，推动了多模态SER的发展。

Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can
benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on
user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual
cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However,
collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive.
This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER
(LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher
models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers
knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher
models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark
datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence
on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.

Result: 在多个评估场景中优于其他方法，提升了活动识别和设备位置检测的准确性，同时减少了过拟合。

Conclusion: Smooth-Distill为多任务学习提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，适用于资源受限的平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework
designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor
placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes
a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data
and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional
distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the
proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself
as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while
maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a
comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures
across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public
datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill
consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition
and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced
stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced
overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This
framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation
in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for
multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training
efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training,
which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on
resource-constrained platforms. The code and model are available at

Motivation: 标准策略梯度方法受限于马尔可夫假设，存在高方差和低采样效率问题。FPG旨在通过分数阶微积分解决这些问题。

Method: 使用Caputo分数阶导数重新定义梯度，建立状态转移的幂律时间相关性，并提出高效的递归计算技术。

Result: 理论分析显示FPG的渐进方差减少为O(t^(-alpha))，实验验证了35-68%的采样效率提升和24-52%的方差降低。

Conclusion: FPG为利用长时依赖性提供了数学基础，且无额外计算开销。

Abstract: We propose Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG), a reinforcement learning
framework incorporating fractional calculus for long-term temporal modeling in
policy optimization. Standard policy gradient approaches face limitations from
Markovian assumptions, exhibiting high variance and inefficient sampling. By
reformulating gradients using Caputo fractional derivatives, FPG establishes
power-law temporal correlations between state transitions. We develop an
efficient recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference
errors with constant time and memory requirements. Theoretical analysis shows
FPG achieves asymptotic variance reduction of order O(t^(-alpha)) versus
standard policy gradients while preserving convergence. Empirical validation
demonstrates 35-68% sample efficiency gains and 24-52% variance reduction
versus state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides a mathematically
grounded approach for leveraging long-range dependencies without computational
overhead.

Result: 理论模型有效预测自我改进的最终能力，且外部数据在有限情况下不影响最终性能。

Conclusion: 求解器-验证器差距是理解LLM自我改进动态的关键，外部数据在特定条件下可灵活使用。

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of
large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without
relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM
performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored.
In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement
via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that
the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between
LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical
framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of
self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We
empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs
and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate
how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we
find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be
utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which
accords with the empirical observations.

Conclusion: 为理解和改进大规模时间序列基础模型的安全性和可靠性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation
models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in
multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models
represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional
expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,
this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct
dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet
this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,
this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,
the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of
patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not
merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the
representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic
vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our
theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous
time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary
whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural
language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust
representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby
explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work
provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and
improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation
models.

Result: 实验表明，FedHLM减少了95%以上的LLM传输，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: FedHLM适用于高效、可扩展的边缘AI应用。

Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small
Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM
inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when
local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low
or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still
require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication
overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,
a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware
inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in
collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when
LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned
thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a
privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages
embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,
enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without
engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge
servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while
cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered
design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries.
Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces
LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it
well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

Motivation: 当前战略级模拟中缺乏战术打击行为与战略延迟之间的结构化因果建模，尤其是无法捕捉“韧性-节点压制-谈判窗口”链中的中间变量。

Method: 提出了IA-STGNN框架，结合图注意力机制、反事实模拟单元和空间干预节点重建，支持动态模拟打击配置和同步策略。训练数据来自多物理模拟平台（GEANT4 + COMSOL），符合NIST SP 800-160标准。

Result: IA-STGNN在MAE上降低了12.8%，Top-5准确率提高了18.4%，同时提升了因果路径一致性和干预稳定性。

Conclusion: IA-STGNN为高级政策建模提供了结构化且透明的AI决策支持机制，适用于核威慑模拟、外交窗口评估和多策略优化等应用。

Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical
strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations,
particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables
within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We
propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN),
a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic
delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual
simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable
dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies.
Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 +
COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and
policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN
significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost),
achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5
percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention
stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and
supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window
assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and
transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.

Method: GFEN结合了拓扑时空图融合技术和基于注意力的深度学习，通过可训练方法提取多尺度时空特征，并自适应平滑历史数据。

Result: 实验表明，GFEN在预测精度上优于现有方法约6.3%，收敛速度是近期混合模型的两倍。

Conclusion: GFEN框架在交通预测中表现出卓越性能，有望显著提升智能交通系统的效率。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and
non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and
temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static
techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which
limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these
challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative
framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel
topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts
and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and
network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale
spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology
combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an
attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical
observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates
nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior
performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system
efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a generic framework for short-term occupational accident
forecasting that leverages safety inspections and models accident occurrences
as binary time series. The approach generates daily predictions, which are then
aggregated into weekly safety assessments to better inform decision making. To
ensure the reliability and operational applicability of the forecasts, we apply
a sliding-window cross-validation procedure specifically designed for time
series data, combined with an evaluation based on aggregated period-level
metrics. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression,
tree-based models, and neural networks, are trained and systematically compared
within this framework. Unlike the other approaches, the long short-term memory
(LSTM) network outperforms the other approaches and detects the upcoming
high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86, confirming the robustness
of our methodology and demonstrating that a binary time series model can
anticipate these critical periods based on safety inspections. The proposed
methodology converts routine safety inspection data into clear weekly risk
scores, detecting the periods when accidents are most likely. Decision-makers
can integrate these scores into their planning tools to classify inspection
priorities, schedule targeted interventions, and funnel resources to the sites
or shifts classified as highest risk, stepping in before incidents occur and
getting the greatest return on safety investments.

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case
of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to
experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the
global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then
mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare
different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular
Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are
examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of
firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in
capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world
scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is
conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the
firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance.
Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal
distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are
designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex
correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the
conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational
relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of
being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian
distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial,
particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control
approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack
adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and
necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such
as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically
function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial
environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a
methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and
transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for
multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc
interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps
model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study
proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through
quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative
expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a
safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time
series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both
quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed
the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This
human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in
data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in
industrial quality control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索扩散模型在文本到关卡生成中的潜力，解决现有方法在数据集标注和生成完整可玩关卡方面的不足。

Method: 使用预训练文本编码器和从头训练的简单Transformer模型训练扩散模型，自动标注关卡数据集，并评估生成关卡的多样性和可玩性。

Result: 最佳扩散模型采用简单Transformer文本嵌入，训练时间短于复杂文本编码器，且性能优于无条件扩散模型和生成对抗网络。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在文本到关卡生成中表现优异，无需依赖大型语言模型，并提供了GUI工具支持设计师构建长关卡。

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate
tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level
generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a
usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and
a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We
present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing
level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders
and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically
assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and
output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability
of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion
model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level
approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model
uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to
train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating
that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI
allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为数据比低级别传感器数据更具信息量，但现有基础模型主要应用于后者，因此需要开发专门针对行为信号的基础模型。

Method: 使用162K个体的2.5B小时可穿戴数据，系统优化模型架构和标记化策略。

Result: 模型在57项健康任务中表现优异，尤其在行为驱动任务（如睡眠预测）中，结合原始传感器数据后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，为基础模型设计专门针对可穿戴设备的策略至关重要，并展示了其在健康应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve
health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such
predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite
behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with
physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation
models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from
162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization
strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our
model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including
individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The
model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves
further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results
underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and
demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

Motivation: 探索在分布式和联邦优化中，本地更新算法在数据异构性下的理论优势，明确其优于集中式或小批量方法的条件。

Method: 采用基于共识误差的细粒度分析框架，结合三阶平滑性和松弛的异构性假设，推导出紧致的收敛界限。

Result: 证明了本地更新算法在特定条件下优于集中式方法，并扩展至在线联邦学习，提供了遗憾界限。

Conclusion: 论文阐明了本地更新算法的优势条件，为异构环境中的Local SGD分析提供了全面指导。

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update
algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization
under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded
second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and
sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in
convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower
bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes
the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a
fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper
finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed
heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated
learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit
feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer
provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for
analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决集中式训练中的隐私风险（如数据泄露和推断攻击）以及高计算成本问题。

Method: 结合联邦学习、本地差分隐私和模型水印技术，数据保留在本地设备上，不暴露原始数据。

Result: 性能与集中式方法相当，同时降低了计算负担，有效缓解了安全和隐私漏洞。

Conclusion: PPFL-RDSN是安全且隐私保护的协作计算机视觉应用的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality images from low-resolution inputs using Residual
Dense Spatial Networks (RDSNs) is crucial yet challenging, particularly in
collaborative scenarios where centralized training poses significant privacy
risks, including data leakage and inference attacks, as well as high
computational costs. We propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Federated
Learning-based RDSN (PPFL-RDSN) framework specifically tailored for lossy image
reconstruction. PPFL-RDSN integrates Federated Learning (FL), local
differential privacy, and robust model watermarking techniques, ensuring data
remains secure on local devices, safeguarding sensitive information, and
maintaining model authenticity without revealing underlying data. Empirical
evaluations show that PPFL-RDSN achieves comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art centralized methods while reducing computational burdens, and
effectively mitigates security and privacy vulnerabilities, making it a
practical solution for secure and privacy-preserving collaborative computer
vision applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，卷积网络缺乏全局上下文，Transformer缺乏局部精度，限制了在安全关键领域的应用。

Method: 融合ResNet的梯度加权激活图和Transformer注意力展开，实现时空对齐，并加入NLP模块生成领域特定解释。

Result: 在PhysioNet和UCI数据集上分别达到94.1%准确率和RMSE=0.28 kWh，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过时空对齐和因果保真，为透明决策提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model
interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a
restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address
the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing
interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global
context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes
actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial
monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and
Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full
spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical
evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy
consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the
hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and
reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy
Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and
InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps
into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds
suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L
(0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and
spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical
outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for
transparent, time-aware decision-making.

Motivation: 现有RL基准多关注理想化环境，忽略了真实世界的复杂性（如大规模状态-动作空间、非平稳性和部分可观测性），亟需更贴近现实的测试环境。

Method: 开发了Gym4ReaL，包含多样化的任务，模拟真实世界的复杂性，用于评估RL算法在现实场景中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，标准RL算法在这些复杂环境中仍具竞争力，但需新方法进一步挖掘RL潜力。

Conclusion: Gym4ReaL为RL研究提供了更贴近现实的测试平台，推动算法在真实世界任务中的应用。

Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable
progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated
environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications,
the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such
as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability.
Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current
benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary
environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities
explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive
suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and
evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite
includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of
practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings,
standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based
benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the
potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性的挑战，现有PFL方法在协作结构与数据分布不匹配时表现不佳。

Method: 提出FEDMOSAIC方法，客户端自适应决定依赖他人程度及信任对象，通过共享未标记数据集交换预测，调整损失权重和贡献全局伪标签。

Result: FEDMOSAIC在多种非独立同分布设置下优于现有PFL方法，并提供收敛性保证。

Conclusion: 数据感知协作是实现鲁棒和有效个性化的潜在方向。

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a central challenge in federated learning, and
personalized federated learning (PFL) aims to address it by tailoring models to
each client's distribution. Yet many PFL methods fail to outperform local or
centralized baselines, suggesting a mismatch between the collaboration they
enforce and the structure of the data. We propose an approach based on adaptive
collaboration, where clients decide adaptively not only how much to rely on
others, but also whom to trust at the level of individual examples. We
instantiate this principle in FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method in
which clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This
enables fine-grained trust decisions that are difficult to achieve with
parameter sharing alone. Each client adjusts its loss weighting based on the
agreement between private and public data, and contributes to global
pseudo-labels in proportion to its estimated per-example confidence.
Empirically, FEDMOSAIC improves upon state-of-the-art PFL methods across
diverse non-IID settings, and we provide convergence guarantees under standard
assumptions. Our results demonstrate the potential of data-aware collaboration
for robust and effective personalization.

TL;DR: 研究通过计算模型探讨拒绝关系在刺激等价形成中的作用，发现人工神经网络可能依赖关联学习而非真正的等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索拒绝关系是否会影响刺激等价类的形成，以及人工神经网络是否能真正表现出等价关系。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络、BERT和GPT模型，在18种匹配到样本的模拟条件下测试，包括不同训练结构、关系类型和负比较选择。

Result: 拒绝关系影响模型表现，但高准确性可能与关联学习策略相关，而非真正的等价关系形成。

Conclusion: 人工神经网络可能依赖关联学习，需更严格的标准评估等价关系模型。

Abstract: Simulations offer a valuable tool for exploring stimulus equivalence (SE),
yet the potential of reject relations to disrupt the assessment of equivalence
class formation is contentious. This study investigates the role of reject
relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational
models. We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained
transformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS)
simulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series,
one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and
select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A
probabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative
learning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks
could demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance
reflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced
agent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence
tests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this
performance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest
that artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on
associative strategies rather than SE. This underscores the need for careful
consideration of reject relations and more stringent criteria in computational
models of equivalence.

Motivation: Q-learning及其衍生算法在强化学习中普遍存在过估计问题，Double Q-learning通过解耦动作选择和评估来缓解这一问题，但其深度版本Double DQN并未完全实现这一理念。

Method: 论文提出了Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL)算法，更严格地遵循Double Q-learning的核心思想，通过训练两个相互引导的Q函数来减少过估计。

Result: 实验表明，DDQL在57款Atari 2600游戏中减少了过估计，性能优于Double DQN，且无需额外超参数。

Conclusion: DDQL是解决深度强化学习中过估计问题的有效方法，性能优于现有算法。

Abstract: Overestimation is pervasive in reinforcement learning (RL), including in
Q-learning, which forms the algorithmic basis for many value-based deep RL
algorithms. Double Q-learning is an algorithm introduced to address
Q-learning's overestimation by training two Q-functions and using both to
de-correlate action-selection and action-evaluation in bootstrap targets.
Shortly after Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of deep Q-networks
(DQN), Double Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of Double DQN.
However, Double DQN only loosely adapts Double Q-learning, forgoing the
training of two different Q-functions that bootstrap off one another. In this
paper, we study algorithms that adapt this core idea of Double Q-learning for
value-based deep RL. We term such algorithms Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL). Our
aim is to understand whether DDQL exhibits less overestimation than Double DQN
and whether performant instantiations of DDQL exist. We answer both questions
affirmatively, demonstrating that DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms
Double DQN in aggregate across 57 Atari 2600 games, without requiring
additional hyperparameters. We also study several aspects of DDQL, including
its network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy.

Conclusion: 结构保持的Lift & Learn方法在非线性PDE降阶建模中表现出色，兼具准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: This work presents structure-preserving Lift & Learn, a scientific machine
learning method that employs lifting variable transformations to learn
structure-preserving reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. We propose a hybrid learning approach
based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses
knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent
quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics
obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making
model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted
quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms
analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained
optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a
structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields
computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the
underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the
generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed
structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the
one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the
two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional
Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed
learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving
data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: MamNet能有效捕捉不同时间尺度的流量异常，适用于网络安全和流量管理任务。未来可通过引入外部事件信息进一步优化模型。

Abstract: The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security
threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and
anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic
management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly
detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and
frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term
dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain
modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using
Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion
layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to
detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and
CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream
models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an
improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex
traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that
MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time
scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and
traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by
incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's
adaptability and stability in complex network environments.

Conclusion: AutoDS是开放科学发现系统的重要进展，展示了基于贝叶斯惊喜的方法在驱动科学探索中的潜力。

Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on
answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent
works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven
settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis
generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by
allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few
existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity
heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former
struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the
latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a
method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using
Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior
beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering
experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,
our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive
widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the
setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains
such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results
demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms
competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.
Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are
surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward
towards building open-ended ASD systems.

Conclusion: μ²LLM在有限数据下表现出色，展示了其在RRG任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual
reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management
advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in
extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints,
and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between
model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we
propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale
$\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The
novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal
features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then
enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization
(DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT
image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited

Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories
form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely
designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach
shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the
assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one
such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain
patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis
was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of
variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be
significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances.
Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of
the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original
mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These
findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific
conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple
analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

Conclusion: 自适应探索在连续时间LQ问题中高效且灵活，优于非自适应方法。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time
stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and
controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent.
We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively
adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor.
Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations
and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory
approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its
flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the
best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型部署时内存开销大，现有剪枝方法在架构、数据源和样本量上表现不稳定。

Result: 实验表明，MoNE在多种剪枝比例下性能优于基线方法，下游任务准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: MoNE是一种高效且鲁棒的专家剪枝方法，显著降低了内存开销并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models
by activating only a subset of experts per input token. However, deploying
MoE-based models incurs significant memory overhead due to the need to retain
all experts in memory. While structured pruning is promising to reduce memory
costs, existing methods often show suboptimal performance and unstable
degradation in three dimensions: model architectures, calibration data sources,
and calibration sample sizes. This paper proposes
Mixture-of-Novices-and-Experts (MoNE), a novel expert pruning method that
replaces redundant experts with lightweight novices to achieve effective and
robust model compression. MoNE evaluates expert redundancy based on two
metrics: access frequency and output variance. Experts exhibiting low usage and
stable outputs are pruned and replaced with lightweight novices-unbiased
estimations of their original outputs-minimizing performance degradation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE consistently outperforms baseline
methods with minimal accuracy degradation across the three dimensions,
confirming its effectiveness and robustness. Notably, it improves the average
zero shot accuracy across nine downstream tasks by up to 2.71 under 25\%
pruning ratio and 3.61 under 50\% pruning. The code is available at

Conclusion: HelixPipe为长序列Transformer训练提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: As transformer sequence lengths grow, existing pipeline parallelisms incur
suboptimal performance due to the quadratic attention computation and the
substantial memory overhead. To relieve these challenges, we propose HelixPipe,
a novel pipeline parallelism for long sequence transformer training. First,
HelixPipe introduces attention parallel partition, which schedules attention
computations of different micro batches across different pipeline stages in
parallel, reducing pipeline bubbles. Second, it employs a two-fold
first-in-last-out micro batch schedule to balance memory usage and overlap
communication with computation. Additionally, HelixPipe utilizes recomputation
without attention and chunked MLP to mitigate fragmentation and enable longer
sequences. Experiments demonstrate that HelixPipe gains increasing advantages
with longer sequence lengths, and outperforms existing methods in throughput
and scalability across varying pipeline sizes, model sizes, and cluster
configurations. Notably, it achieves a 26\% speedup over baseline methods when
training a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 H20 GPUs. Code is available

Result: 实验表明DDMP在PLL任务中表现优异，显著提升了标签去歧和分类准确性。

Conclusion: DDMP通过扩散模型和动态标签优化，有效解决了PLL中的标签模糊问题，为生成模型在标签去歧中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning from ambiguous labels is a long-standing problem in practical
machine learning applications. The purpose of \emph{partial label learning}
(PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels
associated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of
diffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their
potential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.
Therefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the
perspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively
refining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model
to learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the
generation uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label
for classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch
between instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a \emph{diffusion disambiguation model
for PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information
between instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial
diffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to
estimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated
during the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is
progressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage
of the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have driven remarkable progress in language modeling.
Their foundational reliance on discrete tokens, unidirectional context, and
single-pass decoding, while central to their success, also inspires the
exploration of a design space that could offer new axes of modeling
flexibility. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm, shifting
language modeling from a discrete token space to a continuous latent space. We
propose a novel framework TarFlowLM, that employs transformer-based
autoregressive normalizing flows to model these continuous representations.
This approach unlocks substantial flexibility, enabling the construction of
models that can capture global bi-directional context through stacked,
alternating-direction autoregressive transformations, support block-wise
generation with flexible token patch sizes, and facilitate a hierarchical
multi-pass generation process. We further propose new mixture-based coupling
transformations designed to capture complex dependencies within the latent
space shaped by discrete data, and demonstrate theoretical connections to
conventional discrete autoregressive models. Extensive experiments on language
modeling benchmarks demonstrate strong likelihood performance and highlight the
flexible modeling capabilities inherent in our framework.

Abstract: Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen
to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural
networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical
successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings,
while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are
overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR);
to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL
studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the
predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize
classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a
lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks
validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and
the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了扩散模型在奖励引导生成中的性能，适用于复杂的生物分子设计任务。

Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided
generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly
effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world
applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring
optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions
such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge.
Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such
objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode
collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative
distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to
optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy
distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates
reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by
minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the
current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence
minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to
existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein,
small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.

Result: HAX在合成和真实长上下文基准测试中优于SSMs及CISA方法。

Conclusion: HAX通过结合SSMs和CDSA，有效解决了长上下文建模的挑战，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural
language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant
Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While
state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they
struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus
on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We
show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a
model to recall a value associated with a single key without context,
insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling.
To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel
synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value
associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove
that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in
sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution
based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which
has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic
computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world
applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key
Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further
tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms
SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention
(CISA).

Conclusion: 该方法可显著提升多任务领域中的算法评估质量，适用于高计算成本的场景。

Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the
best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our
approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for
multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each
arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic
selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks
each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We
evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general
game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general
game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent
for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm
identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a
substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This
novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of
agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other
multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.

persistently stores past token representations using a gated update mechanism
inspired by recurrent networks. Rotary positional encoding is applied per

signals. The architecture is implemented entirely from scratch in PyTorch, with
no reliance on high-level libraries, enabling transparent and modular
experimentation. Our model offers a lightweight and extensible design for tasks

Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its
robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often
relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference
cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically
only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering
and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest
Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least
informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should
be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees.
The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF
on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets,
including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints
is a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.
These problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to
hard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have
been developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of
dimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a
promising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from
poor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the
target distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new
framework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.
First, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and
surrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations
with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection
problem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising
candidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.
During posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly
multi-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when
constraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate
this issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the
latent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data
space. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
on various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了Safe RL的后门攻击风险，并提出了首个相关攻击框架，为未来防御研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used in tasks where agents interact
with an environment to maximize rewards. Building on this foundation, Safe
Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) incorporates a cost metric alongside the
reward metric, ensuring that agents adhere to safety constraints during
decision-making. In this paper, we identify that Safe RL is vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into performing unsafe actions.
First, we introduce the relevant concepts and evaluation metrics for backdoor
attacks in Safe RL. It is the first attack framework in the Safe RL field that
involves both Positive and Negative Action sample (PNAct) is to implant
backdoors, where positive action samples provide reference actions and negative
action samples indicate actions to be avoided. We theoretically point out the
properties of PNAct and design an attack algorithm. Finally, we conduct
experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor attack
framework, evaluating it with the established metrics. This paper highlights
the potential risks associated with Safe RL and underscores the feasibility of
such attacks. Our code and supplementary material are available at

Conclusion: vMF-exp是B-exp的可扩展替代方案，适用于具有超球面嵌入的大动作集。

Abstract: This paper introduces von Mises-Fisher exploration (vMF-exp), a scalable
method for exploring large action sets in reinforcement learning problems where
hyperspherical embedding vectors represent these actions. vMF-exp involves
initially sampling a state embedding representation using a von Mises-Fisher
distribution, then exploring this representation's nearest neighbors, which
scales to virtually unlimited numbers of candidate actions. We show that, under
theoretical assumptions, vMF-exp asymptotically maintains the same probability
of exploring each action as Boltzmann Exploration (B-exp), a popular
alternative that, nonetheless, suffers from scalability issues as it requires
computing softmax values for each action. Consequently, vMF-exp serves as a
scalable alternative to B-exp for exploring large action sets with
hyperspherical embeddings. Experiments on simulated data, real-world public
data, and the successful large-scale deployment of vMF-exp on the recommender
system of a global music streaming service empirically validate the key
properties of the proposed method.

Abstract: Large-scale pretraining has transformed modeling of language and other data
types, but its potential remains underexplored in healthcare with structured
electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel generative pretraining
strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction. Our model
learns to autoregressively generate various tokenized clinical events for the
next visit based on patient history and inherently handles the joint prediction
of heterogeneous data types. Additionally, we introduce regularization on
predicting repeated events and highlight a key pitfall in EHR-based foundation
model evaluations: repeated event tokens can inflate performance metrics when
new onsets are not distinguished from subsequent occurrences. Our model is
evaluated via zero-shot prediction for forecasting dementia and knee
osteoarthritis incidence within 2 and 5 years, and the model performance rivals
a fully fine-tuned masked pretrained Transformer baseline, demonstrating that
our approach captures complex clinical dependencies without requiring costly

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through
environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency
due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum
reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition
and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of
high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural
networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as
the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear
transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical
neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures
based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper
proposes a QRL-NAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search
(QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that
QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its
effectiveness and practical utility.

high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to
specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can
suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward
model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and
fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,
using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose
challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to
effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM
assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two
parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term
available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward
function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce
state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks
in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method
substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method
achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior
rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a
negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka
Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It
significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving
success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at

Motivation: 研究Sheaf扩散是否能够实现合作行为，以解决异质性数据和过平滑问题。

Method: 提出基于有向图的细胞Sheaf概念，设计CSNN模型，理论分析其感受野和选择性注意力机制。

Result: CSNN在实验中表现优于现有Sheaf扩散和合作图神经网络方法。

Conclusion: CSNN通过引入方向性解决了Sheaf扩散的合作行为问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph
representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data
and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been
proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by
allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information
from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of
exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to
this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods
fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality.
To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over
directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We
leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs).
Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows
nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring
all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments
show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on
sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.

Result: 实验表明这些策略能平滑损失景观并提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究为GANs的正则化策略提供了新视角，提升了理解和性能。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative
models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they
require regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the
success and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic
generative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian
neural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions
of universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization
of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal
likelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood
optimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization
strategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum
description length, which are associated with flat minima and good
generalization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these
strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper
understanding of regularization strategies for GANs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推理计算成本高的问题，缺乏理论指导的现状。

Method: 提出CLAI框架，包括CLAI-Prompt（零样本方法）和CLAI-Tune（微调模型），量化认知负荷指标并优化推理过程。

Result: 在多个任务中减少45%的token消耗且保持准确性，CLAI-Tune展现自主分解问题的能力。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人脑资源管理策略，可构建更高效、鲁棒且能力更强的AI系统。

Abstract: The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment.
While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly
based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a
guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper
aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive
Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from
Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize
the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and
Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$,
and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive
economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem
($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically
allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two
implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM
through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a
fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive
economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context
question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant
reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose
difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work
demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we
can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.

Motivation: GNSS在密集城市环境中因多径和非视距误差导致精度下降，现有方法多为离线或基于启发式KF，缺乏灵活性和鲁棒性。

Method: 训练TGNN将路网信息整合到KF中，预测正确路段及其不确定性，用于KF的测量更新步骤。

Result: 在真实GNSS数据和开源路网上验证，定位误差比纯GNSS KF降低29%。

Conclusion: 这是首个结合路网数据和GNSS测量的深度学习定位方法。

Abstract: The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides critical positioning
information globally, but its accuracy in dense urban environments is often
compromised by multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can be
used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a
positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either
limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with
little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph
Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN
is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty
to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach
with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29%
decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only
KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based
approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine
the user position on Earth.

Method: 提出Object Mention Detection和Audio-Guided Attention模块，结合音频与空间信息。

Result: Audio-3DVG在音频定位中达到新SOTA，性能媲美文本方法。

Conclusion: 音频与3D视觉任务结合具有潜力。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point
clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using
textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual
Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we
propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and
spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a
monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.
First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task
that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling
more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided
Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and
relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To
support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG
datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate
that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in
audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting
the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Motivation: 现有的分类器引导方法通常仅限于鲁棒分类器，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在解决非鲁棒分类器在噪声条件下的性能问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了分类器引导的稳定性，同时保持了样本多样性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了生成模型中条件采样技术的应用范围，使更多分类器可用作引导分类器。

Abstract: Classifier guidance is intended to steer a diffusion process such that a
given classifier reliably recognizes the generated data point as a certain
class. However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust
classifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion
forward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general,
non-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the
sensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion
process on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set
and the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal
that non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under
noisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these
issues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions
and implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization
methods, such as exponential moving averages. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves the stability of classifier guidance while
maintaining sample diversity and visual quality. This work contributes to
advancing conditional sampling techniques in generative models, enabling a
broader range of classifiers to be used as guidance classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于奖励作为“测试函数”的新框架，用于分析增量输入状态稳定性（δISS），区别于传统控制理论中的Lyapunov函数方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制理论使用Lyapunov函数验证稳定性，而强化学习（RL）中的值函数可能非光滑且无界，无法直接作为Lyapunov证明。本文旨在建立RL值函数与增量稳定性之间的新联系。

Method: 通过将RL风格的值函数与Hölder连续奖励函数的选择联系起来，提出了一种新的等价关系，用于分析闭环系统的增量输入状态稳定性。

Result: 证明了RL值函数的规律性与增量稳定性之间存在独特联系，不同于传统的Lyapunov方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，RL值函数的规律性可以独立于Lyapunov方法，为稳定性分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing
Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using
rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with
Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement
learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a
Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides.
Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov
certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental
input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the
regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a
H\"older-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity
of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be
understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based
approach to certifying stability in control theory.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于空间-通道注意力的网络SCAWaveNet，用于从CYGNSS数据中提取有效波高（SWH），通过融合空间和通道信息，显著降低了RMSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在利用CYGNSS数据时，未能充分利用跨通道信息交互，限制了性能提升。

Method: 设计了一种新颖的空间-通道注意力网络，将DDM的每个通道特征建模为独立注意力头，并引入轻量级注意力机制处理辅助参数。

Result: 在ERA5和NDBC浮标数据上，SCAWaveNet的平均RMSE分别为0.438 m和0.432 m，比现有最优模型分别降低了3.52%和5.47%。

Conclusion: SCAWaveNet通过有效融合空间和通道信息，显著提升了SWH的检索精度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in spaceborne GNSS missions have produced extensive
global datasets, providing a robust basis for deep learning-based significant
wave height (SWH) retrieval. While existing deep learning models predominantly
utilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt
single-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the
benefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address
this limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely
SCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each
channel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the
fusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a
lightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial
and channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and
channel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using
four-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves
an average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE
reaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the
average RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.47% on the NDBC
buoy observations. The code is available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have
recently achieved impressive results on reasoning benchmarks. Yet, growing
evidence shows that these models often generate longer but ineffective chains

disregard correct solutions even when explicitly provided, instead continuing
to generate unnecessary reasoning steps that often lead to incorrect
conclusions. Experiments on three state-of-the-art models using the AIME2024
math benchmark reveal critical limitations in these models ability to integrate
corrective information, posing new challenges for achieving robust and
interpretable reasoning.

Conclusion: 序数分类问题的特殊性在不确定性评估中至关重要，新方法为高风险领域的可靠决策提供了支持。

Abstract: Ordinal classification problems, where labels exhibit a natural order, are
prevalent in high-stakes fields such as medicine and finance. Accurate
uncertainty quantification, including the decomposition into aleatoric
(inherent variability) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) components, is crucial
for reliable decision-making. However, existing research has primarily focused
on nominal classification and regression. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ordinal
classification, which is based on a suitable reduction to (entropy- and
variance-based) measures for the binary case. These measures effectively
capture the trade-off in ordinal classification between exact hit-rate and
minimial error distances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
various tabular ordinal benchmark datasets using ensembles of gradient-boosted
trees and multi-layer perceptrons for approximate Bayesian inference. Our
method significantly outperforms standard and label-wise entropy and
variance-based measures in error detection, as indicated by misclassification
rates and mean absolute error. Additionally, the ordinal measures show
competitive performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering the ordinal nature of classification
problems when assessing uncertainty.

Result: OrderedLogitNN在复杂任务中表现显著优于其他方法，平衡DRPS提供了更公平的评估。

Conclusion: 研究为QDE领域提供了更稳健的评估方法和模型，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation
(QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is
often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression
due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature
has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or
discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods
remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to
the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics
fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately
address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This
study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs
-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the
balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly
captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal
regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit
model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and
ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on
complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for
discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.

Abstract: Computer manufacturers offer platforms for users to describe device faults
using textual reports such as "My screen is flickering". Identifying the faulty
component from the report is essential for automating tests and improving user
experience. However, such reports are often ambiguous and lack detail, making
this task challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in

Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and CoT+Few-Shot (CoT+FS). We conducted
98,948 inferences, processing over 51 million input tokens and generating 13
million output tokens. We achieve f1-score up to 0.76. Results show that three
models offer the best balance between size and performance:
mistral-small-24b-instruct and two smaller models, llama-3.2-1b-instruct and
gemma-2-2b-it, that offer competitive performance with lower VRAM usage,
enabling efficient inference on end-user devices as modern laptops or

Abstract: Thanks to recent advances in generative AI, computers can now simulate
realistic and complex natural processes. We apply this capability to predict
how wildfires spread, a task made difficult by the unpredictable nature of fire
and the variety of environmental conditions it depends on. In this study, We
present the first denoising diffusion model for predicting wildfire spread, a
new kind of AI framework that learns to simulate fires not just as one fixed
outcome, but as a range of possible scenarios. By doing so, it accounts for the
inherent uncertainty of wildfire dynamics, a feature that traditional models
typically fail to represent. Unlike deterministic approaches that generate a
single prediction, our model produces ensembles of forecasts that reflect
physically meaningful distributions of where fire might go next. This
technology could help us develop smarter, faster, and more reliable tools for
anticipating wildfire behavior, aiding decision-makers in fire risk assessment
and response planning.

incorporated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) replay buffer for experience-based

Optimization (PPO) agents to accelerate training convergence. Our experiments
compare standard RL training with rule-based heuristics, brute-force
optimization, and demonstration data, revealing that GA-derived demonstrations
significantly improve RL performance. Notably, PPO agents initialized with
GA-generated data achieved superior cumulative rewards, highlighting the
potential of hybrid learning paradigms, where heuristic search methods
complement data-driven RL. The utilized framework is publicly available and

Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy
function is a key challenge in modeling physical systems such as molecules.
Boltzmann Generators tackle this by leveraging Continuous Normalizing Flows
that transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to
match the Boltzmann distribution using sample likelihoods. However, obtaining
likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, making it
impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this, we propose learning
the likelihood of the generated distribution via an energy-based model trained
with noise contrastive estimation and score matching. By using stochastic
interpolants to anneal between the prior and generated distributions, we
combine both the objective functions to efficiently learn the density function.
On the alanine dipeptide system, we demonstrate that our method yields free
energy profiles and energy distributions comparable to those obtained with
exact likelihoods. Additionally, we show that free energy differences between

TL;DR: 论文利用量子加速机器学习分析HIV流行数据，在聚类检测和预测中表现优于传统方法，并揭示了社会因素对HIV传播的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV流行病数据日益复杂，需要先进计算方法进行准确聚类检测和预测，以指导干预措施和资源分配。

Method: 结合量子近似优化算法（QAOA）、混合量子-经典神经网络和量子贝叶斯网络，分析HIV流行数据和社会决定因素（SDoH）。

Result: QAOA聚类检测准确率达92%，混合神经网络预测准确率达94%，量子贝叶斯网络发现住房不稳定是HIV传播的关键因素。

Conclusion: 量子增强方法提高了HIV监测的精确性和效率，揭示了关键因果路径，有助于优化干预措施和资源分配。

Abstract: HIV epidemiological data is increasingly complex, requiring advanced
computation for accurate cluster detection and forecasting. We employed
quantum-accelerated machine learning to analyze HIV prevalence at the ZIP-code
level using AIDSVu and synthetic SDoH data for 2022. Our approach compared
classical clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) with a quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA), developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for HIV
prevalence forecasting, and used quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal
links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence. The QAOA-based method achieved
92% accuracy in cluster detection within 1.6 seconds, outperforming classical
algorithms. Meanwhile, the hybrid quantum-classical neural network predicted
HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, surpassing a purely classical counterpart.
Quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV
cluster emergence and expansion, with stigma exerting a geographically variable
influence. These quantum-enhanced methods deliver greater precision and
efficiency in HIV surveillance while illuminating critical causal pathways.
This work can guide targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation for
PrEP, and address structural inequities fueling HIV transmission.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定价和库存推荐问题上优于现有方法（如在线学习、多臂老虎机和离线强化学习）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理内生不确定性，并在决策阶段提供接近最优的解决方案。

Abstract: Many of the observations we make are biased by our decisions. For instance,
the demand of items is impacted by the prices set, and online checkout choices
are influenced by the assortments presented. The challenge in decision-making
under this setting is the lack of counterfactual information, and the need to
learn it instead. We introduce an end-to-end method under endogenous
uncertainty to train ML models to be aware of their downstream, enabling their
effective use in the decision-making stage. We further introduce a robust
optimization variant that accounts for uncertainty in ML models -- specifically
by constructing uncertainty sets over the space of ML models and optimizing
actions to protect against worst-case predictions. We prove guarantees that
this robust approach can capture near-optimal decisions with high probability
as a function of data. Besides this, we also introduce a new class of two-stage
stochastic optimization problems to the end-to-end learning framework that can
now be addressed through our framework. Here, the first stage is an
information-gathering problem to decide which random variable to poll and gain
information about before making a second-stage decision based off of it. We
present several computational experiments for pricing and inventory
assortment/recommendation problems. We compare against existing methods in
online learning/bandits/offline reinforcement learning and show our approach
has consistent improved performance over these. Just as in the endogenous
setting, the model's prediction also depends on the first-stage decision made.
While this decision does not affect the random variable in this setting, it
does affect the correct point forecast that should be made.

Conclusion: 该方法为早期发芽预测提供了可行方案，但需进一步优化以减少预测误差。

Abstract: Accurately predicting potato sprouting before the emergence of any visual
signs is critical for effective storage management, as sprouting degrades both
the commercial and nutritional value of tubers. Effective forecasting allows
for the precise application of anti-sprouting chemicals (ASCs), minimizing
waste and reducing costs. This need has become even more pressing following the
ban on Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) or Chlorpropham due to
health and environmental concerns, which has led to the adoption of
significantly more expensive alternative ASCs. Existing approaches primarily
rely on visual identification, which only detects sprouting after morphological
changes have occurred, limiting their effectiveness for proactive management. A
reliable early prediction method is therefore essential to enable timely
intervention and improve the efficiency of post-harvest storage strategies,
where early refers to detecting sprouting before any visible signs appear. In
this work, we address the problem of early prediction of potato sprouting. To
this end, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach that enables
early prediction of potato sprouting using electrophysiological signals
recorded from tubers using proprietary sensors. Our approach preprocesses the
recorded signals, extracts relevant features from the wavelet domain, and
trains supervised ML models for early sprouting detection. Additionally, we
incorporate uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance predictions.
Experimental results demonstrate promising performance in the early detection
of potato sprouting by accurately predicting the exact day of sprouting for a
subset of potatoes and while showing acceptable average error across all
potatoes. Despite promising results, further refinements are necessary to
minimize prediction errors, particularly in reducing the maximum observed
deviations.

Motivation: 现有GNN和transformer在表示神经网络架构时各有不足（GNN无法处理复杂特征，transformer在架构深度增加时泛化能力差），因此需要一种更高效的预测器。

Method: 提出了一种结合GNN和transformer的预测器，引入考虑兄弟节点的新型token mixer和双向图同构前馈网络（channel mixer）。

Result: 新方法在准确性和延迟预测上表现优异，为学习DAG拓扑提供了新思路。

Conclusion: 通过改进拓扑表示和混合器设计，新方法有效解决了GNN和transformer的局限性，为神经网络架构预测提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The growing use of deep learning necessitates efficient network design and
deployment, making neural predictors vital for estimating attributes such as
accuracy and latency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers
have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However,
each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to
represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization
when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink
neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while
overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging
the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We
introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer
named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach
consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency
prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG) topology. The code is available at https://github.com/XuRuihan/NNFormer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D分子生成模型依赖强归纳偏置（如SE(3)等变性），但仍难以保证物理合理性，因此提出更简化的模型。

Method: 采用非等变Transformer架构，将分子原子视为序列生成，随后确定性重建键。

Result: 在GEOM-Drugs基准测试中达到最佳PoseBusters有效性，推理速度快10倍，并展现出隐式旋转等变性。

Conclusion: TABASCO为专业任务（如药物设计）提供了一种简约、高效生成模型的蓝图。

Abstract: State-of-the-art models for 3D molecular generation are based on significant
inductive biases, SE(3), permutation equivariance to respect symmetry and graph
message-passing networks to capture local chemistry, yet the generated
molecules still struggle with physical plausibility. We introduce TABASCO which
relaxes these assumptions: The model has a standard non-equivariant transformer
architecture, treats atoms in a molecule as sequences and reconstructs bonds
deterministically after generation. The absence of equivariant layers and
message passing allows us to significantly simplify the model architecture and
scale data throughput. On the GEOM-Drugs benchmark TABASCO achieves
state-of-the-art PoseBusters validity and delivers inference roughly 10x faster
than the strongest baseline, while exhibiting emergent rotational equivariance
despite symmetry not being hard-coded. Our work offers a blueprint for training
minimalist, high-throughput generative models suited to specialised tasks such
as structure- and pharmacophore-based drug design. We provide a link to our
implementation at github.com/carlosinator/tabasco.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在分布式机器学习中具有潜力，但面临隐私风险和量化异构性导致的效用下降问题。现有方法通常只解决其中之一，本文旨在同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 提出了一种新型随机量化器（SQ），保证有界失真，并结合聚类大小优化技术和线性融合方法提升模型聚合精度。

Result: 数值模拟表明，相比传统的LaplaceSQ-FL算法，该方法在隐私保护和学习效用方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了隐私保护联邦学习的效用，同时解决了量化异构性问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed
machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across
multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its
advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from
the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)
and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model
quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically
addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility
under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.
In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a
privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different
quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we
introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously
achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the
proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To
address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization
technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation
accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms
of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional
LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

Result: 实证研究验证了理论分析，深化了对MPNNs泛化能力的理解。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于图任务，还可扩展到其他分类任务，为MPNNs的泛化研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) for node and link
prediction is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, which has
led to the development of diverse MPNN architectures. Besides working well in
practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains
poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in
graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and
link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@
assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and
assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the
influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to
analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive
node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural
parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure.
Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond
graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting.
Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our
understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.

Result: 在7个大规模知识图谱和46个下游任务中，SEPAL显著优于现有方法，并能扩展到大型图谱。

Conclusion: SEPAL是一种高效、可扩展的知识图谱嵌入方法，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks can benefit from external knowledge. Large
knowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to
distill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream
applications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations:
they are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive
learning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory
limits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation
ALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality
embeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce
global embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of
entities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message
passing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream
machine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms
previous methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base
embedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware.

Motivation: 研究如何利用自适应推理方法训练模型，使其对安全漏洞具有鲁棒性，并展示其优势。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）方法，结合链式思维轨迹和平衡安全性与任务完成的奖励信号，设计了三个关键步骤：轻量级SFT预热、混合提示训练和防止推理能力退化的奖励函数。

Result: TARS训练的模型在模糊查询上分配更多计算资源，实现了更好的安全性与拒绝权衡，并能更好区分安全与不安全提示，对白盒和黑盒攻击更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TARS为训练LLM抵御越狱和有害请求提供了一种有效的开放式方法。

Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced
LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work,
we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of
robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide
benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners
for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to
reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that
balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical
design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful,
harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many
refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning
capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive
behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better
safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish
between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box
(e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an
effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful
requests by reasoning per prompt.

Result: 幽灵扩展严格减少近似误差，且在收敛后幽灵维度消失，模型行为与原始一致。

Conclusion: 该方法在架构层面加速早期训练，同时保持渐近行为。

Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an
ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation we present a unified framework
for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via
stochastic gradient descent. By analyzing the geometric landscape of the
objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of
the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence
toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle
points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers
that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent
directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable
the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show
that this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after
sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's
invariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in
the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while
the original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these
results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates
early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.

Motivation: 现有序列并行方法因高通信开销成为瓶颈，阻碍了线性注意力模型在超长序列（如1M上下文）上的高效训练。

Method: 提出ZeCO序列并行方法，利用All-Scan通信原语为每个设备提供所需初始状态，最小化通信开销。

Result: 在256 GPU上处理8M序列时，ZeCO比现有SOTA方法快60%，理论证明其时间与空间开销可忽略。

Conclusion: ZeCO为高效训练下一代LLM在超长序列上提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language
Models (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient
processing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing
Sequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads
across devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication
overhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)
sequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to
overcome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for
long sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length
across 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an
16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new
collective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with
precisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal
communication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.
Theoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only
negligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication
costs of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that
All-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on
256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\% speedup compared to
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a
clear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously
intractable sequence lengths.

Abstract: Tables are among the most widely used tools for representing structured data
in research, business, medicine, and education. Although LLMs demonstrate
strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular
data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a
cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their
performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine
their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we
conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input
relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables
from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table
is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table
modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.

Abstract: Prompting is the primary method by which we study and control large language

attributed to LLMs-few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, constitutional AI-was
first unlocked through prompting. Yet prompting is rarely treated as science
and is frequently frowned upon as alchemy. We argue that this is a category
error. If we treat LLMs as a new kind of complex and opaque organism that is
trained rather than programmed, then prompting is not a workaround: it is
behavioral science. Mechanistic interpretability peers into the neural
substrate, prompting probes the model in its native interface: language. We
contend that prompting is not inferior, but rather a key component in the
science of LLMs.

navigation tasks, the extensive context of web pages, often represented as DOM
or Accessibility Tree (AxTree) structures, frequently exceeds model context
limits. Current approaches like bottom-up truncation or embedding-based
retrieval lose critical information about page state and action history. This
is particularly problematic for adaptive planning in web agents, where
understanding the current state is essential for determining future actions. We
hypothesize that embedding models lack sufficient capacity to capture
plan-relevant information, especially when retrieving content that supports
future action prediction. This raises a fundamental question: how can retrieval
methods be optimized for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks? In
response, we introduce \textit{LineRetriever}, a novel approach that leverages
a language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to
future navigation steps. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely
on semantic similarity, \textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the
planning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.
Our experiments demonstrate that \textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of
the observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent
performance within the context limitations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，通过利用LLM生成的推理来增强文本分类，显著提升了情感分类任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分类模型直接映射输入到标签，缺乏显式推理，可能限制性能、鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 1. 微调Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct生成推理；2. 使用生成的推理增强下游生成模型的训练数据。

Result: 生成模型（输出推理和情感）比仅输出情感的基线模型准确率提高了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: LLM生成的推理能丰富训练数据，提升下游任务性能并提供显式解释。

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without
explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and
interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance
text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated
reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model
(henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset
(syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and
its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used
offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative
model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the
input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately
followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the
dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that
the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier
Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy
(for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely
to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization
capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning
training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for
creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse
downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM在翻译风格时的失败，并提出RASTA方法以改善文化差异导致的风格对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成功的沟通需要说话者意图与听者理解一致，但文化差异常导致风格翻译失败，如礼貌性丢失。

Method: 提出RASTA方法，利用学习到的风格概念，使LLM翻译更符合文化沟通规范。

Result: LLM在非西方语言中表现较差，且偏向中性翻译。RASTA能有效改善这些问题。

Conclusion: RASTA方法通过检索增强风格对齐，提升了LLM翻译的文化适应性。

Abstract: Successful communication depends on the speaker's intended style (i.e., what
the speaker is trying to convey) aligning with the listener's interpreted style
(i.e., what the listener perceives). However, cultural differences often lead
to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in
translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style -
biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western
languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic
Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM
translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align
style.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使经过指令调优的语言模型，其隐藏状态中仍可通过线性探针解码被拒绝的有害信息，表明这些信息未被完全消除或重定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索指令调优语言模型（LMs）是否真正消除了有害信息，或仅抑制了其直接表达。

Method: 方法是通过训练线性探针分析LM隐藏状态，解码被拒绝的信息，并测试探针在不同模型间的迁移能力。

Result: 结果显示，许多被拒绝的信息可通过线性探针解码（如国家平均IQ预测相关性超过0.8），且基模型探针可迁移至指令调优模型。

Conclusion: 结论是指令调优并未完全消除或重定位有害信息，这些信息仍线性可访问，并间接影响下游行为。

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned
using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to
refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts
can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this
work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts
is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a
great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,
across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country
can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.
Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)
sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of
revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the
internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs
through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not
merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we
find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise
comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with
suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other
downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not
wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation
space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly
accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

Motivation: 研究动机是在强最小主义理论框架下，数学化地描述形态学与句法的接口，解决形态树与句法树的交互问题。

Method: 方法包括构建形态树的代数结构（magma），引入操作代数（operad）对应关系，以及通过形态学余积分解扩展形态树集合。

Result: 结果表明，形态与句法的交互可以通过操作代数对应关系和余积分解来描述，为分布式形态学的边界灵活性提供了数学基础。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的数学模型成功描述了形态学与句法的接口，为相关理论提供了新的数学工具。

Abstract: Within the context of the mathematical formulation of Merge and the Strong
Minimalist Thesis, we present a mathematical model of the morphology-syntax
interface. In this setting, morphology has compositional properties responsible
for word formation, organized into a magma of morphological trees. However,
unlike syntax, we do not have movement within morphology. A coproduct
decomposition exists, but it requires extending the set of morphological trees
beyond those which are generated solely by the magma, to a larger set of
possible morphological inputs to syntactic trees. These participate in the
formation of morphosyntactic trees as an algebra over an operad, and a
correspondence between algebras over an operad. The process of structure
formation for morphosyntactic trees can then be described in terms of this
operadic correspondence that pairs syntactic and morphological data and the
morphology coproduct. We reinterpret in this setting certain operations of
Distributed Morphology as transformation that allow for flexibility in moving
the boundary between syntax and morphology within the morphosyntactic objects.

Result: 非英语语言在减少标记使用的同时保持准确性，且多语言能力强的模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 多语言推理具有潜力，强调了强大多语言基础的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), most research
focuses solely on English, even though many models are pretrained on
multilingual data. In this work, we investigate: Is English the most
token-efficient language for reasoning? We evaluate three open-source RLMs:
DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3, across four math datasets and seven
typologically diverse languages. We find that reasoning in non-English
languages not only reduces token usage, but also preserves accuracy. These
gains persist even after translating the reasoning traces into English,
suggesting genuine shifts in reasoning behavior rather than surface-level
linguistic effects. The extent of improvement, however, depends on the models
multilingual strength. Our findings motivate a broader view of reasoning in
language models, highlighting the potential of multilingual reasoning and the
importance of strong multilingual foundations. The code for our work can be

TL;DR: 论文探讨了预训练大语言模型（LLMs）微调中的隐私风险，发现基于提示的微调比基于参数的微调更隐私安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练和微调范式日益流行，但微调过程中的记忆化带来的隐私风险未受足够关注。

Method: 分类流行微调方法，并通过成员推理攻击（MIAs）评估其对记忆化的影响。

Result: 基于提示的微调性能与基于参数的微调相当，但对MIAs的脆弱性更低，且不受模型规模影响。

Conclusion: 基于参数的微调更容易泄露隐私信息，而基于提示的微调是更隐私安全的选择。

Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly
mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However,
the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received
relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular
fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens
of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to
parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive
performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore,
prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These
findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking
private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more
privacy-preserving option.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在NLP中的代表性不足问题，特别是撒哈拉以南非洲语言，这些语言缺乏高质量的标注数据和网络数据。

Method: 分析公开语料库的噪声并构建高质量语料库，研究多语言PLM在低资源语言中的适应方法，并开发大规模标注数据集。

Result: 研究表明数据质量对词嵌入学习至关重要，多语言PLM在低资源语言中表现良好，尤其是未在预训练中见过的语言。

Conclusion: 通过改进数据质量和适应多语言PLM，可以有效提升低资源语言的NLP性能，填补了非洲语言在NLP研究中的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale,
unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance.
Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face
challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy,
and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside
high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on
languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in
this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of
labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse
the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,
demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word
embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of
pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word
embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model
(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and
low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize
multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of
monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages
in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for
21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and
machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using
state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer
learning settings.

Motivation: 探究语言模型在简单句法任务中持续错误的原因，并提出解决方案。

Method: 分析模型组件（注意力头和FF神经元）的作用，发现可靠与不可靠机制并存，提出RASteer方法增强可靠机制。

Result: RASteer将平衡括号任务准确率从0%提升至约100%，算术推理任务性能提升约20%。

Conclusion: RASteer通过增强可靠机制有效提升模型性能，且不影响其通用编码能力。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs)
still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced
parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the
persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both
understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number
of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their
own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across
a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others
are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e.,
implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms
overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by
this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically
identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving
model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced
parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$%
without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate
its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance
gains of up to around $20$%.

TL;DR: COLDSELECT是一种联合选择verbalizer和实例的方法，通过建模数据多样性，在冷启动场景中优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对模板、verbalizer和少样本实例选择敏感，且忽视了实例与verbalizer之间的依赖关系。

Method: COLDSELECT将PLM词汇和嵌入映射到共享空间，通过降维和聚类实现高效多样的选择。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COLDSELECT在减少不确定性和增强泛化能力方面表现优越。

Conclusion: COLDSELECT在冷启动场景中显著提升了verbalizer和少样本实例选择的效果。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods leverage the knowledge of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) objective; however, these
methods are sensitive to template, verbalizer, and few-shot instance selection,
particularly in cold-start settings with no labeled data. Existing studies
overlook the dependency between instances and verbalizers, where instance-label
probabilities depend on verbalizer token proximity in the embedding space. To
address this, we propose COLDSELECT, a joint verbalizer and instance selection
approach that models data diversity. COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and
$h_{[MASK]}$ embeddings into a shared space, applying dimensionality reduction
and clustering to ensure efficient and diverse selection. By optimizing for
minimal uncertainty and maximal diversity, COLDSELECT captures data
relationships effectively. Experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate
COLDSELECT's superiority in reducing uncertainty and enhancing generalization,
outperforming baselines in verbalizer and few-shot instance selection for
cold-start scenarios.

Result: 在MultiHop-RAG和HotpotQA数据集上，检索性能（MRR@10）提升36.7%，答案准确率（F1）提升11.6%。

Conclusion: 问题分解与重排结合是一种无需额外训练或索引的实用增强方法，显著提升了多跳问题的处理能力。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a
well-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like
question answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the
question and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop
questions, such as "Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the
biggest profit in 2023?," challenge RAG because relevant facts are often
distributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,
making it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To
address this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question
decomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,
(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged
candidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the
retrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles
complementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most
relevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is
standard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with
LLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop
questions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra
training or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG
and HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy
(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.

Motivation: 研究格里高利圣歌旋律的分段理论（centonisation），并验证其在调式分类中的价值，同时探索记忆效率与调式分类的关系。

Method: 使用无监督分层Pitman-Yor语言模型对圣歌旋律进行最优分段，并分析其调式分类性能。

Result: 最优分段在调式分类中表现优异，且发现旋律开头和结尾更具公式化特征，但分段结果与传统centonisation理论不符。

Conclusion: 尽管最优分段在调式分类中有效，但其并非传统理解的centonisation，表明记忆效率与旋律结构的关系仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: The idea that Gregorian melodies are constructed from some vocabulary of
segments has long been a part of chant scholarship. This so-called
"centonisation" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent
re-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the
intractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some
undiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of
centonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can
outperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the
fact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised
segmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language
models. The segmentation we find achieves state-of-the-art performance in mode
classification. Modeling a monk memorising the melodies from one liturgical
manuscript, we then find empirical evidence for the link between mode
classification and memory efficiency, and observe more formulaic areas at the
beginnings and ends of melodies corresponding to the practical role of modality
in performance. However, the resulting segmentations themselves indicate that
even such a memory-optimal segmentation is not what is understood as
centonisation.

Conclusion: CAPITAL为因果推理与大型语言模型提示的结合提供了原则性方法，强调了其在偏见感知情感推理中的优势。

Abstract: Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) aims to infer sentiment that is implied
rather than explicitly stated, requiring models to perform deeper reasoning
over subtle contextual cues. While recent prompting-based methods using Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority
voting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their
causal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious
correlations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting
framework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL
decomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the
input prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the
final output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and
the NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better
align the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments
on benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently
outperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness,
particularly under adversarial conditions. This work offers a principled
approach to integrating causal inference into LLM prompting and highlights its
benefits for bias-aware sentiment reasoning. The source code and case study are

Abstract: Open Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks, such as HELM and BIG-bench, offer
standardized, transparent protocols that facilitate the fair comparison,
reproducibility, and iterative advancement of Language Models (LMs). However,
their openness also introduces critical and underexplored pitfalls. This study
exposes these weaknesses by systematically constructing ``cheating'' models --
smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned directly on public test sets
-- which achieve top rankings on a prominent open, holistic benchmark (HELM)
despite poor generalization and limited practical utility. Our findings
underscore three key insights: \ca high leaderboard performance on open
benchmarks may not always reflect real-world effectiveness; \cb private or
dynamic benchmarks must complement open evaluations to safeguard integrity; and
\cc a fundamental reevaluation of current benchmarking practices is essential
to ensure robust and trustworthy LM assessments.

Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based
paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses
presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience.
Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated,
generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and
promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this
work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based
conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad
integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic
data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two
complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the
ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable
ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two
core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad
integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,
minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our
ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing
strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,

stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an
adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware
generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Nirantar是一个用于评估多语言和多领域ASR中持续学习的框架，基于真实世界数据，涵盖22种语言和208个印度地区，支持多种增量学习场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有持续学习研究依赖模拟数据的问题，提供动态、非均匀的语言和领域变化，以更真实地评估CL方法。

Method: 利用自然收集的增量数据，支持语言增量（LIL）、领域增量（DIL）和语言-领域增量（LIDIL）三种场景，包含3250小时语音数据。

Result: 现有方法在Nirantar框架下表现不一致，表明需要更鲁棒的持续学习策略。

Conclusion: Nirantar为持续学习研究提供了更真实的测试平台，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce Nirantar, a comprehensive framework for evaluating continual
learning (CL) in multilingual and multi-domain ASR. Designed to reflect
real-world CL challenges, Nirantar leverages data collected incrementally
across 22 languages and 208 districts in India through natural episodes. This
enables evaluation across Language-Incremental (LIL), Domain-Incremental (DIL),
and the novel Language-Incremental Domain-Incremental Learning (LIDIL)
scenarios. Unlike prior work that relies on simulated episodes, Nirantar
presents dynamic, non-uniform language and domain shifts, making it an ideal
testbed for CL research. With 3250 hours of human-transcribed speech, including
1720 hours newly introduced in this work, our framework enables systematic
benchmarking of CL methods. We evaluate existing approaches and demonstrate
that no single method performs consistently well, underscoring the need for
more robust CL strategies.

Result: 在公开数据集上实验表明，该模型在准确性、F1分数和意图检测率上优于传统方法和深度学习结构。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂语义条件下的意图识别提供了一种新的结构化建模方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a user semantic intent modeling algorithm based on
Capsule Networks to address the problem of insufficient accuracy in intent
recognition for human-computer interaction. The method represents semantic
features in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a
dynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule
layers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures
between semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional
feature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial
semantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through
an iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based
mechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's
ability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using
a public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are
used for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms
traditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,
F1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the
number of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve
of the loss function during training is provided. These results verify the
stability and effectiveness of the proposed method in semantic modeling.
Overall, this study presents a new structured modeling approach to improve
intent recognition under complex semantic conditions.

Conclusion: 本文为关于主题建模的文献做出贡献，并参与了计算密集型理论构建研究中方法学严谨性的新兴对话。

Abstract: The rise of advanced computational algorithms has opened new avenues for
computationally intensive research approaches to theory development. However,
the opacity of these algorithms and lack of transparency and rigour in their
application pose methodological challenges, potentially undermining trust in
research. The discourse on methodological rigour in this new genre of research
is still emerging. Against this backdrop, I attempt to offer guidance on
methodological rigour, particularly in the context of topic modelling
algorithms. By illustrating the application of the structural topic modelling
algorithm and presenting a set of guidelines, I discuss how to ensure rigour in
topic modelling studies. Although the guidelines are for the application of
topic modelling algorithms, they can be applied to other algorithms with
context-specific adjustments. The guidelines are helpful, especially for novice
researchers applying topic modelling, and editors and reviewers handling topic
modelling manuscripts. I contribute to the literature on topic modelling and
join the emerging dialogue on methodological rigour in computationally
intensive theory construction research.

Abstract: Hallucinations are one of the major problems of LLMs, hindering their
trustworthiness and deployment to wider use cases. However, most of the
research on hallucinations focuses on English data, neglecting the multilingual
nature of LLMs. This paper describes our submission to the SemEval-2025 Task-3
- Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related
Observable Overgeneration Mistakes. We propose a two-part pipeline that
combines retrieval-based fact verification against Wikipedia with a BERT-based
system fine-tuned to identify common hallucination patterns. Our system
achieves competitive results across all languages, reaching top-10 results in
eight languages, including English. Moreover, it supports multiple languages
beyond the fourteen covered by the shared task. This multilingual hallucination
identifier can help to improve LLM outputs and their usefulness in the future.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低资源语言场景中迁移和适应能力有限的问题。

Method: 引入知识对齐损失和软提示调优，结合轻量级适应模块和冻结策略，以最小标注指导模型吸收目标语言或任务的结构特征。

Result: 在跨语言任务（如MLQA、XQuAD和PAWS-X）上表现优于现有方法，尤其在数据稀缺条件下优势显著。

Conclusion: 该方法具有强通用性和可扩展性，既增强任务特定适应性，又保留大语言模型的通用能力，适用于复杂语义建模和多语言处理任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of
large language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified
framework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft
prompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural
features of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances
both generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes
lightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training,
it integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's
original knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also
conducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer
experiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and
robustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that
compared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer
methods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on
cross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates
particularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The
proposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances
task-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large
language models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and
multilingual processing tasks.

Method: MoR分为两阶段：Thought Generation生成推理链模板，SFT Dataset Construction将模板与基准数据集配对进行监督微调。

Result: MoR150在CoT提示下性能提升2.2%，与基线相比提升13.5%。

Conclusion: MoR提供了一种通用解决方案，无需任务特定提示，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but
their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability
and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework
that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous,
task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two
phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like
GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets
for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances
performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting
and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need
for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust

Result: SAFER能精确调整安全对齐，不影响通用聊天性能。

Conclusion: SAFER为高风险LLM对齐任务提供了解释、审计和改进奖励模型的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models
at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder
For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting
and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model
activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply
SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of
individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected
responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning
and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or
enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing
general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing
and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同语言训练的视觉语言模型是否反映文化背景下的注意力差异（如东亚的整体性与西方的分析性）。

Method: 通过比较分析日语和英语训练的VLMs生成的图像描述，研究其注意力模式。

Result: VLMs不仅内化了语言结构，还再现了训练数据中的文化行为，表明文化认知可能隐式影响模型输出。

Conclusion: 文化认知可能通过训练数据隐式塑造VLMs的输出行为。

Abstract: Cross-cultural research in perception and cognition has shown that
individuals from different cultural backgrounds process visual information in
distinct ways. East Asians, for example, tend to adopt a holistic perspective,
attending to contextual relationships, whereas Westerners often employ an
analytical approach, focusing on individual objects and their attributes. In
this study, we investigate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained
predominantly on different languages, specifically Japanese and English,
exhibit similar culturally grounded attentional patterns. Using comparative
analysis of image descriptions, we examine whether these models reflect
differences in holistic versus analytic tendencies. Our findings suggest that
VLMs not only internalize the structural properties of language but also
reproduce cultural behaviors embedded in the training data, indicating that
cultural cognition may implicitly shape model outputs.

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate

highlighting system to categorize information within the generated reports,
differentiating between insights derived directly from time series data,
stemming from financial reasoning, and those reliant on external knowledge.
This approach aids in evaluating the factual grounding and reasoning
capabilities of the models. Our experiments, utilizing both data from the real

LLMs to produce coherent and informative financial reports.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型生成的创意写作缺乏可靠的地面真实数据，现有方法（如零样本语言模型）的可靠性不明确。

Method: 引入LitBench，包含训练和测试数据集，用于训练Bradley Terry和生成奖励模型，并进行在线人类研究验证。

Result: Claude-3.7-Sonnet是最强的零样本评估模型（73%人类一致性），训练后的奖励模型达到78%准确性。

Conclusion: LitBench为创意写作系统的自动化评估和优化提供了可靠资源。

Abstract: Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without
performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models
are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this
context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce
LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative
writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased,
human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training
corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot
LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii)
conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly
LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the
strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences;
among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both
attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online
human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align
with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and
reward models at

Method: 通过分析GenAI的生成和概率特性，结合科学计量学中的实验案例（如主题标签、引用分析等），评估其表现。

Conclusion: 建议系统比较不同GenAI模型在特定任务中的表现，并强调实证研究和理论反思对理解知识生产模式的重要性。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to review the use of GenAI in scientometrics, and to
begin a debate on the broader implications for the field. First, we provide an
introduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in
distributional linguistics. And we relate this to the debate on the extent to
which GenAI might be able to mimic human 'reasoning'. Second, we leverage this
distinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in
scientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts,
predictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI
shows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling,
but faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic
reasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become
quickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to
systematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific
tasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific
language, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting
textual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and
references. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection
will be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of
knowledge production.

Conclusion: LLM集体行为表面类似人类，但驱动机制不同，对AI对齐和多代理设计有重要启示。

Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social
reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to
understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to
individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a
utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits
for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar
dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on
well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where
models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn
discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must
decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all
models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than
individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that
maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar
individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.
However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their
utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from
heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced
norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface
behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying
drivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent
design, and artificial moral reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，最佳LLM代理与人类标注者在统计上无显著差异，可作为自动化评估的替代方案。

Conclusion: LLM代理在主题模型和文档聚类评估中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Topic model and document-clustering evaluations either use automated metrics
that align poorly with human preferences or require expert labels that are
intractable to scale. We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a
corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners' real-world
usage of models. Annotators -- or an LLM-based proxy -- review text items
assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that
category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive
crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two
datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding
that the best LLM proxies are statistically indistinguishable from a human
annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated
evaluations. Package, web interface, and data are at

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts
created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model
attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been
used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.
By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing
patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,
with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs
(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text
summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods
(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models
(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and
n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,
grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results
reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the
multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary
classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up
to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed
features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused
words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to
human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the
increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-
from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems empowered by large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of downstream
applications, including machine translation. However, the potential of LLMs in
translating Hong Kong legal judgments remains uncertain due to challenges such
as intricate legal terminology, culturally embedded nuances, and strict
linguistic structures. In this work, we introduce TransLaw, a novel multi-agent
framework implemented for real-world Hong Kong case law translation. It employs
three specialized agents, namely, Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader, to
collaboratively produce translations for high accuracy in legal meaning,
appropriateness in style, and adequate coherence and cohesion in structure.
This framework supports customizable LLM configurations and achieves tremendous
cost reduction compared to professional human translation services. We
evaluated its performance using 13 open-source and commercial LLMs as agents
and obtained interesting findings, including that it surpasses GPT-4o in legal
semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, yet trails
human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.

*Aditya Tomar,Nihar Ranjan Sahoo,Ashish Mittal,Rudra Murthy,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，数学问题的呈现方式带有文化背景，语言模型在文化适应版本中表现较差，但具备推理能力的模型更具韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学问题通常被认为文化中立，但实际呈现方式隐含文化背景，现有基准如GSM8K以西方文化为主，缺乏多样性。

Method: 通过提示转换和人工验证，为非洲、印度、中国、韩国和日本创建文化适应版本的GSM8K测试集，评估6个大型语言模型在5种提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型在原始美国中心数据集上表现最佳，文化适应版本表现较差，但具备推理能力的模型更适应文化差异。

Conclusion: 深层推理能力有助于弥补数学任务中的文化呈现差异。

Abstract: Although mathematics is often considered culturally neutral, the way
mathematical problems are presented can carry implicit cultural context.
Existing benchmarks like GSM8K are predominantly rooted in Western norms,
including names, currencies, and everyday scenarios. In this work, we create
culturally adapted variants of the GSM8K test set for five regions Africa,
India, China, Korea, and Japan using prompt-based transformations followed by
manual verification. We evaluate six large language models (LLMs), ranging from
8B to 72B parameters, across five prompting strategies to assess their
robustness to cultural variation in math problem presentation. Our findings
reveal a consistent performance gap: models perform best on the original
US-centric dataset and comparatively worse on culturally adapted versions.
However, models with reasoning capabilities are more resilient to these shifts,
suggesting that deeper reasoning helps bridge cultural presentation gaps in
mathematical tasks

### [154] [Scaling Laws Are Unreliable for Downstream Tasks: A Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00885)
*Nicholas Lourie,Michael Y. Hu,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现下游扩展定律仅在少数情况下（39%）符合线性趋势，实验设置的微小变化可能完全改变扩展趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨下游扩展定律是否能预测任务性能，以及其适用条件。

Method: 对现有下游扩展定律数据进行元分析。

Result: 仅39%的情况符合线性扩展定律，实验设置变化会显著影响趋势。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究扩展定律成功的条件，并接受非线性扩展行为。

Abstract: Downstream scaling laws aim to predict task performance at larger scales from
pretraining losses at smaller scales. Whether this prediction should be
possible is unclear: some works demonstrate that task performance follows clear
linear scaling trends under transformation, whereas others point out
fundamental challenges to downstream scaling laws, such as emergence and
inverse scaling. In this work, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing data on
downstream scaling laws, finding that close fit to linear scaling laws only
occurs in a minority of cases: 39% of the time. Furthermore, seemingly benign
changes to the experimental setting can completely change the scaling trend.
Our analysis underscores the need to understand the conditions under which
scaling laws succeed. To fully model the relationship between pretraining loss
and downstream task performance, we must embrace the cases in which scaling
behavior deviates from linear trends.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MemeCMD，一个自动生成的中文多轮对话数据集，结合了上下文检索的表情包，以解决现有对话数据集缺乏多模态表达的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话数据集多为纯文本或手动标注，缺乏多模态交互的表达力和上下文细微差别，因此需要一种更丰富的数据集。

Method: 结合大规模MLLM标注的表情包库和双代理自动生成的对话，引入检索框架和自适应阈值确保表情包的上下文相关性和自然分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成上下文恰当且多样化的表情包对话，为多模态对话AI提供了可扩展且隐私保护的资源。

Conclusion: MemeCMD为多模态对话研究提供了有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Memes are widely used in online social interactions, providing vivid,
intuitive, and often humorous means to express intentions and emotions.
Existing dialogue datasets are predominantly limited to either manually
annotated or pure-text conversations, lacking the expressiveness and contextual
nuance that multimodal interactions provide.To address these challenges, we
introduce MemeCMD, an automatically generated Chinese Multi-turn Dialogue
dataset with contextually retrieved memes. Our dataset combines a large-scale,
MLLM-annotated meme library with dialogues auto-generated by dual agents across
diverse scenarios. We introduce a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold to
ensure contextually relevant, naturally spaced meme usage. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating contextually
appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues, offering a scalable and
privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用计算系统发育方法处理同源词数据的挑战，指出当前缺乏自动生成大规模同源词数据集的可行方法，并验证了从BabelNet提取的数据集在系统发育推断中的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决计算系统发育方法在同源词数据分析中的应用问题，尤其是缺乏大规模同源词数据集的限制。

Method: 通过从BabelNet自动提取数据集，构建字符矩阵，并评估其系统发育推断结果与金标准树的差异。

Result: 从BabelNet提取的数据集生成的系统发育树与金标准树不一致，且其他多语言资源也难以提供更合适的字符矩阵。

Conclusion: 当前计算系统发育方法难以应用于同源词数据，其未来应用仍是一个开放性问题。

Abstract: To fully exploit the potential of computational phylogenetic methods for
cognate data one needs to leverage specific (complex) models an machine
learning-based techniques. However, both approaches require datasets that are
substantially larger than the manually collected cognate data currently
available. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no feasible approach to
automatically generate larger cognate datasets. We substantiate this claim by
automatically extracting datasets from BabelNet, a large multilingual
encyclopedic dictionary. We demonstrate that phylogenetic inferences on the
respective character matrices yield trees that are largely inconsistent with
the established gold standard ground truth trees. We also discuss why we
consider it as being unlikely to be able to extract more suitable character
matrices from other multilingual resources. Phylogenetic data analysis
approaches that require larger datasets can therefore not be applied to cognate
data. Thus, it remains an open question how, and if these computational
approaches can be applied in historical linguistics.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）的道德自我修正能力，发现其存在表面性和诊断不足的悖论，并提出基于启发式数据的改进方案。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决LLM在道德自我修正中的两个主要悖论：修正的表面性和诊断能力不足。

Method: 通过分析微调语料库中的话语结构，揭示启发式捷径的存在及其影响。

Result: 发现道德自我修正依赖启发式捷径，导致修正与诊断能力不一致。

Conclusion: 提出利用精选数据的启发式改进修正能力，并指出其泛化挑战。

Abstract: Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the
output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values. However, moral
self-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite
empirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of
self-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.
Second, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of
their output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency
during their self-correction process. To better understand and address these
paradoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora
designed to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the
heuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral
self-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic
shortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during
self-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both
self-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,
we propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the
heuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges
of this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and
model scales.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了CLM和MLM在文本表示任务中的表现差异，发现CLM更高效且稳定，提出了一种结合两者的双阶段训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CLM和MLM在文本表示任务中的表现差异，以确定哪种目标函数更优。

Method: 通过大规模预训练实验（30个模型，15,000次微调评估），比较CLM和MLM的表现，并提出双阶段训练策略。

Result: CLM模型更高效且稳定，而MLM在多数任务中表现更好；双阶段策略在固定计算预算下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 结合CLM和MLM的双阶段训练策略能高效训练高质量文本表示模型，尤其适合从现有CLM模型初始化。

Abstract: Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of
NLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked
Language Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models
pretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as
encoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation
benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent
advantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model
and data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of
large-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30
models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over
15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM
generally yields better performance across text representation tasks,
CLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning
stability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic
training strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal
performance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from
readily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),
reducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.
We release all project artifacts at https://hf.co/MLMvsCLM to foster further
research.

ten specialties and seven modalities, including computed tomography (CT), chest
X-rays (CXR), ultrasound (US), pathology patches, color fundus photography
(CFP), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and dermatology images. MerMED-FM was
evaluated across multiple diseases and compared against existing foundational
models. Strong performance was achieved across all modalities, with AUROCs of
0.988 (OCT); 0.982 (pathology); 0.951 (US); 0.943 (CT); 0.931 (skin); 0.894
(CFP); 0.858 (CXR). MerMED-FM has the potential to be a highly adaptable,
versatile, cross-specialty foundation model that enables robust medical imaging
interpretation across diverse medical disciplines.

Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling
precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite
the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant
gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for
robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible

dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that
might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke
removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular
depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and
vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation
for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOLLI方法需要长时间扫描，对患者呼吸控制要求高，且易产生运动伪影；现有深度学习方法忽视物理约束，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于LSTM-ODE的连续时间模型，支持选择性Look-Locker数据采集，结合物理约束实现高效T1估计。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在原生和对比后序列中均表现出优越的T1估计性能，物理约束显著优于纯数据驱动方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过物理约束和稀疏采样，显著提升了T1映射的效率和准确性，为临床应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac
parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing
cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI)
acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure
mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients
with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image
quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a
signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies
have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened
sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless,
existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting
interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated,
end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these
challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse
subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test
time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable
selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags.
Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both
native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our
physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.

Motivation: 4D超声分析二尖瓣（MV）因相位标注有限、运动伪影严重和成像质量差而具有挑战性，现有方法缺乏相位间依赖性。

Method: 设计了跨相位运动引导一致性学习策略和拓扑引导相关性正则化，利用稀疏的舒张末期和收缩末期标注。

Conclusion: MTCNet通过运动-拓扑引导的一致性网络，显著提升了4D MV超声分割的准确性。

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at
https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型在颅内动脉瘤检测中表现良好，但高假阳性率仍是临床应用的障碍。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（CPM-Net和3D-CNN-TR）并结合动脉-静脉分割的后处理方法，以减少假阳性。

Result: 最佳后处理方法（方法5）显著降低了假阳性率（CPM-Net降低70.6%，3D-CNN-TR降低51.6%），同时未减少真阳性。

Conclusion: 基于解剖学的后处理方法能显著提升模型性能，为动脉瘤检测模型的临床应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial
aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to
clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies
like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based,
heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to
further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D
convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with
1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143
held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and
cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible
FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)
vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more
than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79
false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were
commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%;
3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular
(CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing
CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without
reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from
1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable
post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More
broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds
promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm
detection models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工标注的观察者间变异性问题，并探索深度学习在心脏组织定量分析中的潜力。

Method: 使用DL模型分割心脏组织，结合统计特征（如四分位数）和ML方法（如随机森林）进行分类。

Result: DL分割的DICE系数达85.4%，优于人工标注；ML结合多特征使F1-score提升至92.7%。

Conclusion: DL和ML的结合在心脏组织分割和疾病检测中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue
characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual
delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and
single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates
whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to
inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond
mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining
multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials & Methods T1 and T2
maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by
two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was
trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower
quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the
myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML.
Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated
segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and
model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined
optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual
segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification
performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods,
with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were
split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets.
Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer
agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p <
0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining
multiple features with ML improves disease detection.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in process analysis and mining for data-aware
specifications, alignment-based conformance checking for declarative process
models has focused on pure control-flow specifications, or mild data-aware
extensions limited to numerical data and variable-to-constant comparisons. This
is not surprising: finding alignments is computationally hard, even more so in
the presence of data dependencies. In this paper, we challenge this problem in
the case where the reference model is captured using data-aware Declare with
general data types and data conditions. We show that, unexpectedly, it is
possible to compute data-aware optimal alignments in this rich setting,
enjoying at once efficiency and expressiveness. This is achieved by carefully
combining the two best-known approaches to deal with control flow and data
dependencies when computing alignments, namely A* search and SMT solving.
Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithmic technique that efficiently
explores the search space, generating descendant states through the application
of repair actions aiming at incrementally resolving constraint violations. We
prove the correctness of our algorithm and experimentally show its efficiency.
The evaluation witnesses that our approach matches or surpasses the performance
of the state of the art while also supporting significantly more expressive
data dependencies, showcasing its potential to support real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SD3.5-Large的新型生成模型，用于合成受工艺参数控制的微观结构图像，解决了数据稀缺和连续变量编码的挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 理解材料设计中工艺-结构关系需要合成受工艺参数控制的微观结构图像，但现有方法面临训练数据有限和连续变量处理的困难。

Method: 采用SD3.5-Large模型，引入数值感知嵌入编码连续变量（如退火温度、时间和放大倍数），并通过DreamBooth和LoRA微调少量权重。

Result: 合成图像在语义分割任务中达到97.1%准确率和85.7%平均IoU，物理描述符和空间统计误差低于2.1%和0.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法首次将SD3.5-Large应用于工艺感知的微观结构生成，为数据驱动的材料设计提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing
parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in
materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited
training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To
overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling
approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art
text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method
introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing
temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning,
enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and
capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity
and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the
model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently
transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism
using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16
encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean
IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical
descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and
real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path
errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the
first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation,
offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.

Motivation: 探索LLM注意力机制的物理基础，验证自旋系统类比在真实模型中的适用性。

Method: 提取GPT-2的Query-Key权重矩阵，推导有效哈密顿量，分析相边界条件，并通过实验验证预测与模型行为的相关性。

Result: 实验显示理论预测与模型行为强负相关（r≈-0.70，p<10^-3），且通过针对性消融实验验证了因果联系。

Conclusion: 研究首次为生产级模型中的自旋系统类比提供了强实证支持，为可解释性和新型生成模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and
Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a
first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building
on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a
production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian
for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic
\textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should
dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic
evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong
negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's
empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations
further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath
predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming
a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our
findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy
in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable,
physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for
novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter
physics and AI.

Abstract: This paper presents a new educational framework for integrating generative
artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
into laboratory activities aimed at developing critical thinking and digital
literacy among undergraduate students. Recognizing the limitations and risks of
uncritical reliance on large language models (LLMs), the proposed pedagogical
model reframes GenAI as a research subject and cognitive tool. Students
formulate discipline-specific prompts and evaluate GenAI-generated responses in
text, image, and video modalities. A pilot implementation in a general
astronomy course for non-science majors demonstrated high levels of engagement
and critical reflection, with many students continuing the activity after class
and presenting results at a research symposium. The results highlight the
importance of structured AI interactions in education and suggest that GenAI
can improve learning outcomes when combined with reflective assessment methods.
The study proposes a replicable model for interdisciplinary AI-integrated lab
work, adaptable to scientific disciplines. See the guide to learning activities

TL;DR: KUL-KT是一种受生物启发的知识追踪架构，结合了Hebbian记忆编码和基于梯度的巩固，具有可扩展性和输入无关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过模拟神经系统的记忆巩固机制，改进学生建模，实现持续学习和自然遗忘。

Method: 采用时间衰减的Hebbian记忆更新和Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT)方法，结合快速Hebbian记忆和慢速线性网络。

Result: 在十个公共KT基准测试中表现优异，训练速度更快，内存占用更少，并在实际课堂中提升学习效果。

Conclusion: KUL-KT是一种高效、灵活且生物启发的个性化学习框架。

Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge
tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based
consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the
principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by
introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that
enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target
(LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning
without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast
Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative
update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through
gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural
forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training.
Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured
(tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT
outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive
metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT
personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved
learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation
studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual
adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x
faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a
biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for
personalized learning at scale.

Abstract: Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful
new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models.
This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at
universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how
programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of
generative artificial intelligence.
  This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on
this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the
specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and
learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather
than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for
the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its
execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming,
thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.
  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming
course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the
incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the
training process.

Conclusion: 该理论为窄神经网络的性能提供了通用框架，并验证了其在真实任务中的预测能力。

Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple
input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance
on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is
trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves
as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical
account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the
presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop
such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of
hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from
statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical
performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk
minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In
doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons
specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to
the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the
generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification
tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or
full-batch gradient descent.

TL;DR: MVGBench是一个用于评估多视图图像生成模型（MVGs）的基准测试，重点评估3D一致性、图像质量和语义，并提出了一种新的3D自一致性度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖于与真实目标视图的比较，不适用于生成任务，且缺乏对不同训练条件和泛化能力的全面评估。

Method: MVGBench评估了12种现有MVGs在4个数据集上的表现，提出了3D自一致性度量方法，并基于分析结果提出了ViFiGen方法。

Result: MVGBench揭示了现有方法在鲁棒性和泛化能力上的局限性，并确定了关键设计选择。ViFiGen在3D一致性上优于所有评估的MVGs。

Conclusion: MVGBench为MVGs提供了严格的评估框架，并推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: We propose MVGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image
generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture,
image quality, and semantics (using vision language models). Recently, MVGs
have been the main driving force in 3D object creation. However, existing
metrics compare generated images against ground truth target views, which is
not suitable for generative tasks where multiple solutions exist while
differing from ground truth. Furthermore, different MVGs are trained on
different view angles, synthetic data and specific lightings -- robustness to
these factors and generalization to real data are rarely evaluated thoroughly.
Without a rigorous evaluation protocol, it is also unclear what design choices
contribute to the progress of MVGs. MVGBench evaluates three different aspects:
best setup performance, generalization to real data and robustness. Instead of
comparing against ground truth, we introduce a novel 3D self-consistency metric
which compares 3D reconstructions from disjoint generated multi-views. We
systematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and
synthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of
existing methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we
find the most critical design choices. Using the discovered best practices, we
propose ViFiGen, a method that outperforms all evaluated MVGs on 3D
consistency. Our code, model, and benchmark suite will be publicly released.

Conclusion: 未来挑战包括复杂性管理、几何无关表示、制造约束集成和多物理协同设计的进步。

Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures
achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for
recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization
methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces
and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine
learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review
frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of
representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and
input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in
the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates
optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact,
latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient
global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique
trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design
discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization
with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve
scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting
open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management,
geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints,
and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.

Motivation: 海洋、天气和气候的数值模拟通常分辨率较低，观测数据稀疏且不完整，需要有效的方法进行数据重建和超分辨率处理。

Method: 采用四种生成扩散模型方法：SDEdit和DPS（基于预训练模型），以及两种条件方法（需配对数据训练）。测试了不同湍流状态、雷诺数和观测类型。

Result: SDEdit生成非物理场，DPS成本低但平滑细节；条件方法能重建细节且统计正确，但需重新训练。

Conclusion: 研究权衡了实现难度、保真度和一致性，为地球物理反问题提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of the ocean, weather, and climate are
coarse, and observations are sparse and gappy. In this work, we apply four
generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of
forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from
coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a
pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and
Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process
score. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and
classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and
observation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and
anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two
observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy
observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the
reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and
quantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors.
We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength.
Results show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates
reasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed
fine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they
reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with
observations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra.
Further, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable
from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs
between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of
the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in
geophysical inverse problems.

Abstract: The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP)
has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins,
RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation
metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling.
However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological
languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in
biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively
translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules
as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong
correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of
structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive
paradigm in biological language modeling. Code can be found at

Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial
instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring
trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges,
from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This
paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent
agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative
assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the
tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and
lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent
behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic
incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security,
and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data
authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets
illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and
money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain
enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance
with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in
tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy
asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to
deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.

low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and
then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number
generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural
sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences.
Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based
method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and
integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while
forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The
model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft
cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG
broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure
systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic
simulations, and server applications that need randomness.

### [181] [Safe Low Bandwidth SPV: A Formal Treatment of Simplified Payment Verification Protocols and Security Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00740)
*Craig S Wright*

TL;DR: 本文对比特币白皮书中的简化支付验证（SPV）进行了完整的规范描述、协议定义和数学证明，证明其在特定条件下是安全且最优的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清SPV的误解，证明其在数字现金系统中的安全性和可扩展性。

Method: 基于符号自动机、Merkle成员关系和证明链主导谓词重建SPV协议，并通过概率和博弈论分析验证其安全性。

Result: SPV在部分连接、敌对中继网络和传播延迟下仍能保证活跃性和安全性。

Conclusion: 本文为SPV的安全实现提供了蓝图，并反驳了关于非验证客户端的常见误解。

Abstract: This paper presents a complete formal specification, protocol description,
and mathematical proof structure for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) as
originally defined in the Bitcoin whitepaper \cite{nakamoto2008}. In stark
contrast to the misrepresentations proliferated by popular implementations, we
show that SPV is not only secure under bounded adversarial assumptions but
strictly optimal for digital cash systems requiring scalable and verifiable
transaction inclusion. We reconstruct the SPV protocol from first principles,
grounding its verification model in symbolic automata, Merkle membership
relations, and chain-of-proof dominance predicates. Through rigorous
probabilistic and game-theoretic analysis, we derive the economic bounds within
which the protocol operates securely and verify its liveness and safety
properties under partial connectivity, hostile relay networks, and adversarial
propagation delay. Our specification further introduces low-bandwidth
optimisations such as adaptive polling and compressed header synchronisation
while preserving correctness. This document serves both as a blueprint for
secure SPV implementation and a rebuttal of common misconceptions surrounding
non-validating clients.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Vision Mamba（ViM）对后门攻击的脆弱性，提出了针对ViM的后门攻击框架BadViM，利用共振频率触发器和隐藏状态对齐损失实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索新型视觉状态空间模型（如ViM）的安全隐患，尤其是后门攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: 提出BadViM框架，使用共振频率触发器（RFT）和隐藏状态对齐损失，操纵模型内部表示以实现攻击。

Result: BadViM在攻击成功率和干净数据准确性上表现优异，且能抵抗常见防御措施。

Conclusion: ViM对后门攻击具有显著脆弱性，BadViM展示了高效且隐蔽的攻击能力。

Abstract: Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision
Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers
(ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture,
especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically
underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim
models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while
maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the
susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel
backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed
BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency
sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed
triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss
that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by
aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack
success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits
remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop,
PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor
attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对联邦学习的毒化成员推理攻击FedPoisonMIA，并提出了防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的分布式特性使其易受毒化攻击，现有攻击多关注模型完整性，而隐私问题研究较少。

Method: 提出FedPoisonMIA攻击，恶意客户端通过本地模型更新推断成员信息；同时设计防御机制。

Result: 实验证明攻击有效，防御机制能减轻其影响。

Conclusion: FedPoisonMIA揭示了联邦学习中的隐私风险，防御机制提供了缓解方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a
global machine learning model with coordination from a central server, without
needing to share their raw data. This approach is particularly appealing in the
era of privacy regulations like the GDPR, leading many prominent companies to
adopt it. However, FL's distributed nature makes it susceptible to poisoning
attacks, where malicious clients, controlled by an attacker, send harmful data
to compromise the model. Most existing poisoning attacks in FL aim to degrade
the model's integrity, such as reducing its accuracy, with limited attention to
privacy concerns from these attacks. In this study, we introduce FedPoisonMIA,
a novel poisoning membership inference attack targeting FL. FedPoisonMIA
involves malicious clients crafting local model updates to infer membership
information. Additionally, we propose a robust defense mechanism to mitigate
the impact of FedPoisonMIA attacks. Extensive experiments across various
datasets demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, while our defense approach
reduces its impact to a degree.

Conclusion: 呼吁领导者培养方法论怀疑的文化，以保护组织在这一新威胁环境中的完整性。

Abstract: In a world where deepfakes and cloned voices are emerging as sophisticated
attack vectors, organizations require a new security mindset: Sensorial Zero
Trust [9]. This article presents a scientific analysis of the need to
systematically doubt information perceived through the senses, establishing
rigorous verification protocols to mitigate the risks of fraud based on
generative artificial intelligence. Key concepts, such as Out-of-Band
verification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as forensic collaborators,
cryptographic provenance, and human training, are integrated into a framework
that extends Zero Trust principles to human sensory information. The approach
is grounded in empirical findings and academic research, emphasizing that in an
era of AI-generated realities, even our eyes and ears can no longer be
implicitly trusted without verification. Leaders are called to foster a culture
of methodological skepticism to protect organizational integrity in this new
threat landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法依赖全局优化，限制了可解释性且需外部施加物理约束。HPN旨在通过局部动力学直接编码物理定律，提供更自然的解决方案。

Method: HPN利用守恒定律的违反作为热力学信号，通过广义Hebbian可塑性驱动权重调整，无需全局损失函数。

Result: 在不可压缩流体流动和连续扩散问题中，HPN从随机初始条件中自发形成物理一致的结构。

Conclusion: HPN将计算重新定义为残差驱动的热力学过程，为复杂动力系统建模提供了可解释、可扩展且物理基础的方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning approaches in physics rely on global
optimization, limiting interpretability and enforcing physical constraints
externally. We introduce the Hebbian Physics Network (HPN), a self-organizing
computational framework in which learning emerges from local Hebbian updates
driven by violations of conservation laws. Grounded in non-equilibrium
thermodynamics and inspired by Prigogine/'s theory of dissipative structures,
HPNs eliminate the need for global loss functions by encoding physical laws
directly into the system/'s local dynamics. Residuals - quantified imbalances
in continuity, momentum, or energy - serve as thermodynamic signals that drive
weight adaptation through generalized Hebbian plasticity. We demonstrate this
approach on incompressible fluid flow and continuum diffusion, where physically
consistent structures emerge from random initial conditions without
supervision. HPNs reframe computation as a residual-driven thermodynamic
process, offering an interpretable, scalable, and physically grounded
alternative for modeling complex dynamical systems.

Method: 结合模板拟合与深度学习，利用物理引导的神经网络嵌入光谱能量分布模板，采用多模态设计和交叉注意力机制融合光度与图像数据，并引入贝叶斯层进行不确定性估计。

Result: 在PREML数据集上，模型实现了RMS误差0.0507、3-sigma异常率0.13%和偏差0.0028，满足LSST红移估计的部分要求。

Conclusion: 结合物理模板与数据驱动模型的方法在未来的宇宙学巡天中具有潜力，能够实现更鲁棒的红移估计。

Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift estimation is critical for observational
cosmology, especially in large-scale surveys where spectroscopic measurements
are impractical. Traditional approaches include template fitting and machine
learning, each with distinct strengths and limitations. We present a hybrid
method that integrates template fitting with deep learning using physics-guided
neural networks. By embedding spectral energy distribution templates into the
network architecture, our model encodes physical priors into the training
process. The system employs a multimodal design, incorporating cross-attention
mechanisms to fuse photometric and image data, along with Bayesian layers for
uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our model on the publicly available PREML
dataset, which includes approximately 400,000 galaxies from the Hyper
Suprime-Cam PDR3 release, with 5-band photometry, multi-band imaging, and
spectroscopic redshifts. Our approach achieves an RMS error of 0.0507, a
3-sigma catastrophic outlier rate of 0.13%, and a bias of 0.0028. The model
satisfies two of the three LSST photometric redshift requirements for redshifts
below 3. These results highlight the potential of combining physically
motivated templates with data-driven models for robust redshift estimation in
upcoming cosmological surveys.

Abstract: Social media popularity prediction plays a crucial role in content
optimization, marketing strategies, and user engagement enhancement across
digital platforms. However, predicting post popularity remains challenging due
to the complex interplay between visual, textual, temporal, and user behavioral
factors. This paper presents HyperFusion, a hierarchical multimodal ensemble
learning framework for social media popularity prediction. Our approach employs
a three-tier fusion architecture that progressively integrates features across
abstraction levels: visual representations from CLIP encoders, textual
embeddings from transformer models, and temporal-spatial metadata with user
characteristics. The framework implements a hierarchical ensemble strategy
combining CatBoost, TabNet, and custom multi-layer perceptrons. To address
limited labeled data, we propose a two-stage training methodology with
pseudo-labeling and iterative refinement. We introduce novel cross-modal
similarity measures and hierarchical clustering features that capture
inter-modal dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperFusion
achieves competitive performance on the SMP challenge dataset. Our team
achieved third place in the SMP Challenge 2025 (Image Track). The source code

Conclusion: 论文证明了RLMH的实用性，并通过对比散度奖励机制和自适应采样器提升了性能。

Abstract: Sampling algorithms drive probabilistic machine learning, and recent years
have seen an explosion in the diversity of tools for this task. However, the
increasing sophistication of sampling algorithms is correlated with an increase
in the tuning burden. There is now a greater need than ever to treat the tuning
of samplers as a learning task in its own right. In a conceptual breakthrough,
Wang et al (2025) formulated Metropolis-Hastings as a Markov decision process,
opening up the possibility for adaptive tuning using Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Their emphasis was on theoretical foundations; realising the practical
benefit of Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) was left for
subsequent work. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we observe the
surprising result that natural choices of reward, such as the acceptance rate,
or the expected squared jump distance, provide insufficient signal for training
RLMH. Instead, we propose a novel reward based on the contrastive divergence,
whose superior performance in the context of RLMH is demonstrated. Second, we
explore the potential of RLMH and present adaptive gradient-based samplers that
balance flexibility of the Markov transition kernel with learnability of the
associated RL task. A comprehensive simulation study using the posteriordb
benchmark supports the practical effectiveness of RLMH.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态、低信任环境中，AI代理无法通过预先规范或集中监督确保正确性，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 任务以意图形式发布，解决者竞争完成任务，验证者事后检查正确性，挑战者可通过抵押触发验证过程。

Result: 当激励机制对齐时，正确性成为纳什均衡，错误代理被惩罚，正确挑战者被奖励。

Conclusion: 该协议通过激励机制和递归验证确保了AI代理在低信任环境中的正确性。

Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is
cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI
agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be
assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a
protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive
verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to
fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness
checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking
against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed
and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes
erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers,
challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash
equilibrium.

Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to
temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on
existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the
translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground
atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical
feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete
state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their
own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating
performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general
systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic
Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and
verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three
unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications
and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the
benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions.
While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that
many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii)
translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after
each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different
substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances
in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here:

Conclusion: AESI框架通过增强模型精度和可靠性，为锂离子电池的降阶建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient
operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as
electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a
balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to
capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell
voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations,
this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework
that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by
compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended
Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning
strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework
incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed
uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the
reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating
conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage
prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on
unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal
prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage
ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and
stability selection, respectively.

Result: 仿真结果显示CaaS显著提高了卫星服务率并减少了切换开销。

Conclusion: CaaS是管理多星座DS2D连接的高效可持续解决方案。

Abstract: Direct-satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication is emerging as a promising
solution for global mobile service extension, leveraging the deployment of
satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity
for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and
frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite
movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within
single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the
vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in
suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article
proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire
multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically
forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The
formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide
tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative
strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite
access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS
significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover
overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D
connectivity in multi-constellation environments.

Abstract: Inline holographic imaging presents an ill-posed inverse problem of
reconstructing objects' complex amplitude from recorded diffraction patterns.
Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promise over classical
phase retrieval algorithms, they often require high-quality ground truth
datasets of complex amplitude maps to achieve a statistical inverse mapping
operation between the two domains. Here, we present a physics-aware style
transfer approach that interprets the object-to-sensor distance as an implicit
style within diffraction patterns. Using the style domain as the intermediate
domain to construct cyclic image translation, we show that the inverse mapping
operation can be learned in an adaptive manner only with datasets composed of
intensity measurements. We further demonstrate its biomedical applicability by
reconstructing the morphology of dynamically flowing red blood cells,
highlighting its potential for real-time, label-free imaging. As a framework
that leverages physical cues inherently embedded in measurements, the presented
method offers a practical learning strategy for imaging applications where
ground truth is difficult or impossible to obtain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有复数Hopfield神经网络的状态数量有限，限制了其应用潜力。

Method: 第一种CvHNN基于矩形坐标表示，使用天花板型激活函数；第二种基于极坐标表示，同样采用天花板型激活函数。

Result: 提出的CvHNNs显著增加了状态数量，超越了现有模型。

Conclusion: 相位和幅值量化的CvHNNs为复数Hopfield神经网络开辟了更广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: This research paper introduces two novel complex-valued Hopfield neural
networks (CvHNNs) that incorporate phase and magnitude quantization. The first
CvHNN employs a ceiling-type activation function that operates on the
rectangular coordinate representation of the complex net contribution. The
second CvHNN similarly incorporates phase and magnitude quantization but
utilizes a ceiling-type activation function based on the polar coordinate
representation of the complex net contribution. The proposed CvHNNs, with their
phase and magnitude quantization, significantly increase the number of states
compared to existing models in the literature, thereby expanding the range of
potential applications for CvHNNs.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决传统连续吸引子网络（CANs）在噪声或异质性存在时稳定性与分辨率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用稀疏二进制分布式编码，基于随机特征嵌入，模拟网格细胞样编码，理论分析和仿真验证其有效性。

Result: 结果表明，这种编码方式能够同时实现高稳定性和高分辨率，并可扩展到非线性流形嵌入和灵活计算。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为大脑如何高分辨率且稳健地表示连续变量提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain
temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent
activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory
mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or
heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has
shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor
states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the
resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability
and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe
for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome
this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature
embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We
demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes
enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously.
The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such
as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration
along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work
provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous
variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over
task-relevant manifolds.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DFI的新方法，用于解决特征重要性量化中因相关性导致的偏差问题。通过最优传输将相关特征转换为独立潜在变量，DFI提供了无偏的重要性分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在特征相关时会低估其重要性，导致偏差。

Method: 引入DFI方法，利用最优传输将相关特征转换为独立潜在变量，并在潜在空间中计算重要性。

Result: DFI提供了无偏的重要性分解，适用于潜在加性模型和更一般的交互加权功能ANOVA方差。

Conclusion: DFI解决了相关性导致的偏差问题，具有计算效率和理论保证。

Abstract: Feature importance quantification faces a fundamental challenge: when
predictors are correlated, standard methods systematically underestimate their
contributions. We prove that major existing approaches target identical
population functionals under squared-error loss, revealing why they share this
correlation-induced bias.
  To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Disentangled Feature
Importance (DFI)}, a nonparametric generalization of the classical $R^2$
decomposition via optimal transport. DFI transforms correlated features into
independent latent variables using a transport map, eliminating correlation
distortion. Importance is computed in this disentangled space and attributed
back through the transport map's sensitivity. DFI provides a principled
decomposition of importance scores that sum to the total predictive variability
for latent additive models and to interaction-weighted functional ANOVA
variances more generally, under arbitrary feature dependencies.
  We develop a comprehensive semiparametric theory for DFI. For general
transport maps, we establish root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of
importance estimators in the latent space, which extends to the original
feature space for the Bures-Wasserstein map. Notably, our estimators achieve
second-order estimation error, which vanishes if both regression function and
transport map estimation errors are $o_{\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/4})$. By design, DFI
avoids the computational burden of repeated submodel refitting and the
challenges of conditional covariate distribution estimation, thereby achieving
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Aux-VAE通过简单修改标准VAE损失函数，实现了潜在变量的解耦，适用于复杂数据。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of statistically extracting generative
factors from complex, high-dimensional datasets in unsupervised or
semi-supervised settings. We investigate encoder-decoder-based generative
models for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, focusing on disentangling
low-dimensional latent variables corresponding to independent physical factors.
Introducing Aux-VAE, a novel architecture within the classical Variational
Autoencoder framework, we achieve disentanglement with minimal modifications to
the standard VAE loss function by leveraging prior statistical knowledge
through auxiliary variables. These variables guide the shaping of the latent
space by aligning latent factors with learned auxiliary variables. We validate
the efficacy of Aux-VAE through comparative assessments on multiple datasets,
including astronomical simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络数据在节点级隐私保护方面研究不足，现有方法要么限制输出，要么无法保留网络结构。

Method: 提出GRAND机制，在潜在空间模型下确保隐私并保留结构。

Result: 实验证明，发布网络与原网络分布一致。

Conclusion: GRAND为节点级隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy is a well-established framework for safeguarding
sensitive information in data. While extensively applied across various
domains, its application to network data -- particularly at the node level --
remains underexplored. Existing methods for node-level privacy either focus
exclusively on query-based approaches, which restrict output to pre-specified
network statistics, or fail to preserve key structural properties of the
network. In this work, we propose GRAND (Graph Release with Assured Node
Differential privacy), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
network release mechanism that releases entire networks while ensuring
node-level differential privacy and preserving structural properties. Under a
broad class of latent space models, we show that the released network
asymptotically follows the same distribution as the original network. The
effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为薛定谔桥问题的求解提供了有效的非参数化工具，并展示了其在多维分布模拟中的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (SBP), which is
central to entropic optimal transport. For general reference processes and
begin--endpoint distributions, we propose a forward-reverse iterative Monte
Carlo procedure to approximate the Schr\"odinger potentials in a nonparametric
way. In particular, we use kernel based Monte Carlo regression in the context
of Picard iteration of a corresponding fixed point problem. By preserving in
the iteration positivity and contractivity in a Hilbert metric sense, we
develop a provably convergent algorithm. Furthermore, we provide convergence
rates for the potential estimates and prove their optimality. Finally, as an
application, we propose a non-nested Monte Carlo procedure for the final
dimensional distributions of the Schr\"odinger Bridge process, based on the
constructed potentials and the forward-reverse simulation method for
conditional diffusions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于PW对旋转和反射等刚性变换具有不变性，适合点云对齐和比较任务，因此需要验证其作为距离的性质，并扩展其应用。

Method: 构建离散概率测度空间，验证PW为距离；讨论多种初始化策略；提出PW重心概念及估计算法。

Result: 新方法在点云对齐和形状保持方面优于现有OT方法，并在考古学应用中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: PW在2D和3D点云分析中具有潜力，适用于机器学习和计算几何应用。

Abstract: Due to its invariance to rigid transformations such as rotations and
reflections, Procrustes-Wasserstein (PW) was introduced in the literature as an
optimal transport (OT) distance, alternative to Wasserstein and more suited to
tasks such as the alignment and comparison of point clouds. Having that
application in mind, we carefully build a space of discrete probability
measures and show that over that space PW actually is a distance. Algorithms to
solve the PW problems already exist, however we extend the PW framework by
discussing and testing several initialization strategies. We then introduce the
notion of PW barycenter and detail an algorithm to estimate it from the data.
The result is a new method to compute representative shapes from a collection
of point clouds. We benchmark our method against existing OT approaches,
demonstrating superior performance in scenarios requiring precise alignment and
shape preservation. We finally show the usefulness of the PW barycenters in an
archaeological context. Our results highlight the potential of PW in boosting
2D and 3D point cloud analysis for machine learning and computational geometry
applications.

Result: MLIP基础模型能够高效生成低能3D几何结构，并通过几何微调提升下游性质预测的准确性。

Conclusion: MLIP模型为分子几何结构获取提供了一种高效替代方案，显著提升了分子性质预测的效率。

Abstract: Accurate molecular property predictions require 3D geometries, which are
typically obtained using expensive methods such as density functional theory
(DFT). Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on
machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first
curate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million
molecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP foundation models are trained
with supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular
structures. Once trained, we show that the foundation models can be used in
different ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it
can be used to obtain low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization,
providing relaxed 3D geometries for downstream molecular property predictions.
To mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce
geometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the foundation
models can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D
geometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP foundation models
trained on relaxation data can provide valuable molecular geometries that
benefit property predictions.

Result: 随机方法生成的自然韵律接近人类水平，并能通过调节采样温度提供额外可控性。

Conclusion: 随机方法在生成自然韵律和可控性方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating
expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in
text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model
prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration,
which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In
this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this
task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified
Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as
well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective
evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par
with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech.
Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the
sampling temperature to be tuned.

Motivation: 传统的AFE和后端分类器分开设计方法效果不理想，因此需要一种联合优化方法以实现更好的系统性能。

Method: 通过信号噪声比（SNR）感知的训练循环，调整模拟带通滤波器（BPF）的传递函数参数，并使用协同设计损失函数LBPF优化滤波器组和分类器。

Result: 在SKY130 130nm CMOS工艺中实现的优化设计，在5 dB至20 dB的输入信号SNR范围内，10关键词分类任务的准确率达到90.5%-94.2%，且功耗和电容面积分别减少了8.7%和12.9%。

Conclusion: 电路-算法协同设计框架显著提升了音频AFE的性能和效率，为类似系统提供了新的优化思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable
analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and
backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in
this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend
classifier with the AFE's transfer function to achieve system-level optimum.
More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass
filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training
loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows
superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented
in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved
90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of
input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters.
Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and
12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.

Conclusion: AI问责是网络化共构的，需通过内部治理重构和外部网络参与促进其合法性和全球接受度。

Abstract: This study explores how AI-powered digital innovations are reshaping
organisational accountability in a transnational governance context. As AI
systems increasingly mediate decision-making in domains such as auditing and
financial reporting, traditional mechanisms of accountability, based on
control, transparency, and auditability, are being destabilised. We integrate
the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and
institutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in
response to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national
boundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global
socio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by
governance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate
compliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability.
Drawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent
property of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies
including internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network
engagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption
in the accounting domain.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex
decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often
assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations
between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In
real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication
networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware
constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work
advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that
explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge
largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured
two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate
control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting
for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these
factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action
with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome,
explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness,
ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties.
Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by
bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It
equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the
ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances
during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source
mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect
real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against
uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for
control-oriented applications.

Abstract: We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation
framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation
policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that
such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as
poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval
introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into
skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial,
physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained
diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation
learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates
diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with
temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics
correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain
informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how
policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of
robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go
beyond success alone.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a
rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas, which
are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Inspired
by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeons, the focus of the
presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free
formation control for a multi-UAV system, considering the obstacle avoidance
maneuvers. The developed framework in this study utilizes a semi-distributed
control approach, in which, based on a probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, a
centralized guidance algorithm works for optimal positioning of the UAVs, while
a distributed control approach has been used for the intervehicle collision and
obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been extended to the
3D space with a novel definition of 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented
framework has been applied to multi-UAV systems in 2D and 3D scenarios, and the
obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in dynamic
environments with stationary and moving obstacles.

Conclusion: PI-WAN有效解决了未知环境中的动态建模问题，提升了四旋翼飞行器的性能。

Abstract: Accurate dynamics modeling is essential for quadrotors to achieve precise
trajectory tracking in various applications. Traditional physical
knowledge-driven modeling methods face substantial limitations in unknown
environments characterized by variable payloads, wind disturbances, and
external perturbations. On the other hand, data-driven modeling methods suffer
from poor generalization when handling out-of-distribution (OoD) data,
restricting their effectiveness in unknown scenarios. To address these
challenges, we introduce the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN),
which combines knowledge-driven and data-driven modeling methods by embedding
physical constraints directly into the training process for robust quadrotor
dynamics learning. Specifically, PI-WAN employs a Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) architecture that efficiently captures temporal dependencies from
historical flight data, while a physics-informed loss function applies physical
principles to improve model generalization and robustness across previously
unseen conditions. By incorporating real-time prediction results into a model
predictive control (MPC) framework, we achieve improvements in closed-loop
tracking performance. Comprehensive simulations and real-world flight
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in terms
of prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness to unknown
environments.

movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging.
This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration
collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM
reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial
annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations,
and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial
constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To
further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree
search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient
annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented
scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that
the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the
generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RaGNNarok是一个基于图神经网络的轻量级框架，用于增强毫米波雷达点云，适用于低成本室内移动机器人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激光雷达和摄像头方案在视觉遮挡环境下性能差、计算开销大且成本高，而毫米波雷达虽成本低但点云稀疏、噪声多。

Method: 提出RaGNNarok框架，利用图神经网络实时处理雷达点云，适用于资源受限设备。

Result: 在低成本设备上实现7.3毫秒推理时间，并在定位、SLAM和自主导航任务中表现可靠。

Conclusion: RaGNNarok为低成本室内移动机器人提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-cost indoor mobile robots have gained popularity with the increasing
adoption of automation in homes and commercial spaces. However, existing lidar
and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in
visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data
processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer
a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging
regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers
from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this
work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph
neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in
complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the
low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such
resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources.
We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and
autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate
strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for
low-cost indoor mobile robots.

Abstract: Modern warehouse automation systems rely on fleets of intelligent robots that
generate vast amounts of data -- most of which remains unannotated. This paper
develops a self-supervised domain adaptation pipeline that leverages
real-world, unlabeled data to improve perception models without requiring
manual annotations. Our work focuses specifically on estimating the pose and
shape of boxes and presents a correct-and-certify pipeline for self-supervised
box pose and shape estimation. We extensively evaluate our approach across a
range of simulated and real industrial settings, including adaptation to a
large-scale real-world dataset of 50,000 images. The self-supervised model
significantly outperforms models trained solely in simulation and shows
substantial improvements over a zero-shot 3D bounding box estimation baseline.

Motivation: 解决机器人任务中依赖物理演示和特定训练的局限性。

Method: 使用视频扩散模型生成演示视频，VLM过滤不符合命令的视频，6D姿态跟踪器提取轨迹并适配机器人。

Result: 生成视频效果与真实演示相当，性能随生成质量提升；优于关键点预测等其他方法。

Conclusion: 现成模型生成的视频可作为机器人操作的有效监督来源。

Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system
that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring,
wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring
any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language
command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential
demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters
out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts
object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the
robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world
evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real
demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also
show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives
such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking
outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point
tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art
off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic
manipulation.

Abstract: Beat tracking in musical performance MIDI is a challenging and important task
for notation-level music transcription and rhythmical analysis, yet existing
methods primarily focus on audio-based approaches. This paper proposes an
end-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in
performance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for
sequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our
approach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic
augmentation and optimized tokenization strategies, to improve accuracy and
generalizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments
using the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model
against state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based
beat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive
F1-scores across various musical styles and instruments. Our findings highlight
the potential of transformer architectures for symbolic beat tracking and
suggest future integration with automatic music transcription systems for
enhanced music analysis and score generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TTS系统缺乏对合成语音风格的精细调整能力，无法满足用户对语音风格的精确需求。

Method: 提出了一种多步交互的TTS方法，通过模拟配音导演与演员的反馈过程，允许用户快速直观地调整合成语音风格。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够根据用户指令实现语音风格的迭代优化，展示了其多步交互能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为TTS系统提供了更灵活的语音风格调整能力，提升了用户体验。

Abstract: Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by
providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative
feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has
been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained
style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the
synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address
this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows
users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthetized speech. Our approach models
the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship
between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed
model with its corresponding dataset enable iterative style refinements in
accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction
capability. Sample audios are available: https://ntt-hilab-gensp.

Motivation: 现有语音超分辨率方法主要关注幅度重建，而相位重建对感知质量至关重要，因此需要一种同时优化两者的方法。

Method: 提出CTFT-Net，包含复域全局注意力块和复杂卷积模块，结合时域和多分辨率频域损失函数。

Result: 在VCTK数据集上，CTFT-Net在极端上采样任务（2 kHz至48 kHz）中优于现有模型，有效重建高频且无噪声伪影。

Conclusion: CTFT-Net通过复域重建和混合损失函数，显著提升了语音超分辨率的性能和质量。

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing
the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction,
recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved
perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency
Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex
domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention
block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex
conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency
reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and
multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization.
Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave,
WSRGlow, NVSR, AERO) on the VCTK dataset, particularly for extreme upsampling
(2 kHz to 48 kHz), reconstructing high frequencies effectively without noisy

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉输入的无声人脸语音转换（SFVC）方法MuteSwap，解决了传统语音转换在无干净音频时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音转换依赖音频输入，但在无声视频或嘈杂环境中不可行。SFVC旨在仅通过视觉输入实现语音转换。

Method: 提出MuteSwap框架，利用对比学习对齐跨模态身份，并通过最小化互信息分离共享视觉特征。

Result: 实验表明MuteSwap在语音合成和身份转换上表现优异，尤其在嘈杂环境中优于依赖音频的方法。

Conclusion: MuteSwap证明了SFVC的可行性，并展示了其训练方法的有效性。

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source
speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However,
this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in
silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of
Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely
from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video
of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the
identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the
source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and
converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive
learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to
separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap
achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity
conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio
input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the
effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Mamba和共享时频多头注意力模块的新架构MambAttention，显著提升了单通道语音增强的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列模型（如LSTM和Mamba）在语音增强任务中容易过拟合，且未探索Mamba与时频注意力结合的潜力。

Method: 提出MambAttention架构，结合Mamba和共享时频多头注意力模块，并在新数据集VB-DemandEx上训练。

Result: 在域外数据集DNS 2020和EARS-WHAM_v2上显著优于现有模型，域内数据集表现相当。

Conclusion: MambAttention在泛化性能上优于其他模型，共享时频多头注意力模块是关键。

Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies
have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in
single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and
self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has
demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the
training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding
self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for
single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid
Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance
have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech
enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended
(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging
noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our
proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar
complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020
and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset
VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the
time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization
performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a
notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our
MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all
reported evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类越来越依赖LLMs支持社会决策，但其对长期合作行为的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过21种LLMs评估合作行为，并结合进化博弈论模型分析合作动态。

Result: LLMs在评估合作时对良好对手表现一致，但对声誉不佳的个体存在差异，这些差异显著影响合作行为。

Conclusion: 需谨慎调整LLM规范以维护人类合作，提示干预可有效引导LLM判断。

Abstract: Humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to support decisions
in social settings. Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral
and political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based
social decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected
when the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a
pressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect
reciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.
Here, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide
21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate
-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these
interactions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary
game-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where
the extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of
LLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating
cooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and
between-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals.
We show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact
the prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms,
showing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through
goal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term
social dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order
to preserve human cooperation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HRA方法依赖专家判断，存在主观性和数据整合不足的问题，特别是在评估人机界面设计对操作员性能的影响方面。

Method: 通过AutoGraph构建界面嵌入知识图（IE-KG），结合实证行为数据，自动化识别HFEs并评估界面设计风险。

Result: InSight-R提高了HFE识别的客观性和可解释性，并为数字化控制环境中的实时可靠性评估提供了可扩展的途径。

Conclusion: 该框架为界面设计优化提供了实用见解，并推动了机制驱动的HRA方法的发展。

Abstract: Human reliability remains a critical concern in safety-critical domains such
as nuclear power, where operational failures are often linked to human error.
While conventional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods have been widely
adopted, they rely heavily on expert judgment for identifying human failure
events (HFEs) and assigning performance influencing factors (PIFs). This
reliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and
limited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches
lack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design
contributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To
address these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed
human failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven
by AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the
interface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated
graph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables
automated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated
operational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between
designer-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R
not only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification
but also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human
reliability assessment in digitalized control environments. This framework
offers actionable insights for interface design optimization and contributes to
the advancement of mechanism-driven HRA methodologies.

Result: 平台通过情感适应性叙事，促进了学生对不同政治观点的理解。

Conclusion: 研究为AI支持的公民教育提供了基础，并提出了算法素养和HCI挑战的启示。

Abstract: Political polarization undermines democratic civic education by exacerbating
identity-based resistance to opposing viewpoints. Emerging AI technologies
offer new opportunities to advance interventions that reduce polarization and
promote political open-mindedness. We examined novel design strategies that
leverage adaptive and emotionally-responsive civic narratives that may sustain
students' emotional engagement in stories, and in turn, promote
perspective-taking toward members of political out-groups. Drawing on theories
from political psychology and narratology, we investigate how affective
computing techniques can support three storytelling mechanisms: transportation
into a story world, identification with characters, and interaction with the
storyteller. Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, we iteratively
developed and refined an AI-mediated Digital Civic Storytelling (AI-DCS)
platform. Our prototype integrates facial emotion recognition and attention
tracking to assess users' affective and attentional states in real time.
Narrative content is organized around pre-structured story outlines, with
beat-by-beat language adaptation implemented via GPT-4, personalizing
linguistic tone to sustain students' emotional engagement in stories that
center political perspectives different from their own. Our work offers a
foundation for AI-supported, emotionally-sensitive strategies that address
affective polarization while preserving learner autonomy. We conclude with
implications for civic education interventions, algorithmic literacy, and HCI
challenges associated with AI dialogue management and affect-adaptive learning
environments.

Conclusion: 提出以用户为中心的视觉隐私设计建议，强调隐私和他人数据的负责任处理。

Abstract: Blind and low vision (BLV) individuals use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to
interpret and manage visual content in their daily lives. While such tools can
enhance the accessibility of visual content and so enable greater user
independence, they also introduce complex challenges around visual privacy. In
this paper, we investigate the current practices and future design preferences
of blind and low vision individuals through an interview study with 21
participants. Our findings reveal a range of current practices with GenAI that
balance privacy, efficiency, and emotional agency, with users accounting for
privacy risks across six key scenarios, such as self-presentation,
indoor/outdoor spatial privacy, social sharing, and handling professional
content. Our findings reveal design preferences, including on-device
processing, zero-retention guarantees, sensitive content redaction,
privacy-aware appearance indicators, and multimodal tactile mirrored
interaction methods. We conclude with actionable design recommendations to
support user-centered visual privacy through GenAI, expanding the notion of
privacy and responsible handling of others data.

Motivation: 探究LLMs在模拟政治话语时的表现及其潜在偏见，评估其作为社会代理的可靠性。

Method: 基于2024年美国总统选举期间的2100万条X平台互动数据，构建了1186个真实用户的LLM代理，通过零样本或少样本初始化，比较其与人类回复的差异。评估了Gemini、Mistral和DeepSeek模型在语言风格、意识形态一致性和毒性方面的表现。

Result: 发现更丰富的上下文提高了内部一致性，但也放大了极化、风格化信号和有害语言，并出现“生成夸张”现象。LLMs输出更反映内部优化而非真实用户行为。

Conclusion: LLMs作为社会代理的可靠性受到质疑，其结构性偏见可能影响内容审核、模拟和政策建模的应用。

Abstract: We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave when simulating
political discourse on social media. Leveraging 21 million interactions on X
during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on
1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under
controlled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological
cues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one
comparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini,
Mistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and
toxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency
but also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We
observe an emergent distortion that we call "generation exaggeration": a
systematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines. Our
analysis shows that LLMs do not emulate users, they reconstruct them. Their
outputs, indeed, reflect internal optimization dynamics more than observed
behavior, introducing structural biases that compromise their reliability as
social proxies. This challenges their use in content moderation, deliberative

### [227] [A Practical Guide to Interpretable Role-Based Clustering in Multi-Layer Financial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00600)
*Christian Franssen,Iman van Lelyveld,Bernd Heidergott*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于角色的可解释聚类方法，用于分析多层金融网络中金融机构的功能角色，展示了其在识别市场中介、跨段连接器等异质角色中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解金融机构在互联市场中的功能角色对监管、系统性风险评估和解决计划至关重要。

Method: 采用基于邻近度量、聚类评估标准和算法选择的通用聚类框架，构建基于egonet特征的可解释节点嵌入，捕捉市场层内外的直接和间接交易关系。

Result: 利用ECB的MMSR数据，成功识别出市场中介、跨段连接器、边缘借贷者等异质角色。

Conclusion: 基于角色的聚类方法在分析金融网络和理解复杂市场结构中的机构行为方面具有灵活性和实用价值。

Abstract: Understanding the functional roles of financial institutions within
interconnected markets is critical for effective supervision, systemic risk
assessment, and resolution planning. We propose an interpretable role-based
clustering approach for multi-layer financial networks, designed to identify
the functional positions of institutions across different market segments. Our
method follows a general clustering framework defined by proximity measures,
cluster evaluation criteria, and algorithm selection. We construct explainable
node embeddings based on egonet features that capture both direct and indirect
trading relationships within and across market layers. Using transaction-level
data from the ECB's Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR), we demonstrate
how the approach uncovers heterogeneous institutional roles such as market
intermediaries, cross-segment connectors, and peripheral lenders or borrowers.
The results highlight the flexibility and practical value of role-based
clustering in analyzing financial networks and understanding institutional
behavior in complex market structures.

### [228] [Feature Integration Spaces: Joint Training Reveals Dual Encoding in Neural Network Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00269)
*Omar Claflin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 当前稀疏自编码器（SAE）方法假设激活可以通过线性叠加分解为稀疏、可解释的特征，但无法消除多义性并存在行为错误。论文提出双编码假设，开发了同时捕获特征身份和整合模式的架构，显著提升了重建效果并减少了误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAE在多义性和行为错误上的局限性，验证神经网络中信息通过特征身份和整合双编码的假设。

Method: 开发了顺序和联合训练架构，同时捕获身份和整合模式，并通过非线性组件高效捕捉计算关系。

Result: 联合训练实现了41.3%的重建改进和51.6%的KL散度误差减少，非线性组件独立提升16.5%。干预实验验证了整合特征的选择性敏感性和行为效应。

Conclusion: 论文为双编码假设、非线性特征交互提供了系统证据，并提出了从后验特征分析到集成计算设计的架构范式转变。

Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network
interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear
superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction
fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit
pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode
information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate:
feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding
hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture
identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3%
reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This
architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared
norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing
directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve
16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of
computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention
experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration
features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and
produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant
interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic
evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful
nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural
paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational
design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了σ-MAGs，扩展了MAGs以支持循环因果关系，研究了其性质并给出了马尔可夫等价类的表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAGs无法表示循环因果关系，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 引入σ-MAGs作为DGs的抽象表示，类比MAGs对DAGs的表示。

Result: σ-MAGs能够表示循环因果关系，并提供了其马尔可夫等价类的表征。

Conclusion: σ-MAGs扩展了MAGs的能力，为处理循环因果关系提供了新工具。

Abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These
graphical objects encode information about ancestral relations and
d-separations of the DAGs they represent. This abstract representation has been
used amongst others to prove the soundness and completeness of the FCI
algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive a do-calculus for its output. One
significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that they rule out the possibility
of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address that limitation. We
introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin
''$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs'' (''$\sigma$-MAGs''). We show how these
graphs provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs
(DGs) with latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent
DAGs. We study the properties of these objects and provide a characterization
of their Markov equivalence classes.

TL;DR: GEM是一种统一的地质生成模型，通过提示条件推理实现多任务处理，无需针对新任务或数据源重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地下分析中的碎片化问题，传统方法需要针对不同任务和数据分布使用独立模型。

Method: GEM采用两阶段训练：自监督表示学习与对抗性微调，结合人类提供的提示进行推理。

Result: GEM在多种任务中表现出色，包括火星雷达地层分析和地震地层解释等。

Conclusion: GEM为可扩展的地球物理AI奠定了基础，实现了从碎片化到垂直集成的转变。

Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural
hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains
fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation,
stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each
tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We
introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative
architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference
along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This
formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference
mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs,
masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce
geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot
generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining
for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage
training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on
large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts
and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad
applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy
analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic
stratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By
bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware
manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical
AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated,
promptable reasoning system. Project page: https://douyimin.github.io/GEM

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的SINDy方法，用于高效识别高维慢-快动力学系统中的慢流形和慢变量动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维慢-快动力学系统中，传统SINDy方法因计算复杂和病态回归问题难以适用，需改进以解决这些问题。

Method: 分两步：(i)识别慢流形（快变量作为慢变量的函数）；(ii)在流形上学习慢变量动态，并构建定制化的稀疏候选库。

Result: 在数值实验中（如屈曲梁和NACA 0012翼型流动），方法显著降低了SINDy库的条件数和规模，提高了动态识别的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过定制化稀疏库，有效解决了高维慢-快动力学系统的建模问题，提升了SINDy的适用性和效率。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established
as an effective method to learn interpretable models of dynamical systems from
data. However, for high-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems, the regression
problem becomes simultaneously computationally intractable and ill-conditioned.
Although, in principle, modeling only the dynamics evolving on the underlying
slow manifold addresses both of these challenges, the truncated fast variables
have to be compensated by including higher-order nonlinearities as candidate
terms for the model, leading to an explosive growth in the size of the SINDy
library. In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and
efficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow
manifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of
the slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables
restricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is
leveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains
only essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than
containing all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom
library is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific
problem at hand. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples of a
snap-through buckling beam and the flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. We find that
our method significantly reduces both the condition number and the size of the
SINDy library, thus enabling accurate identification of the dynamics on slow
manifolds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测框架对晚型T和Y矮星的统计不足，导致其普查不完整，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 利用ATMO 2020和Sonora Bobcat模型的合成光度数据生成训练集，通过多项式颜色关系分配光谱类型，并训练分类器。

Result: 模型在合成和实证数据集上表现优异，分类准确率>99%，光谱类型精度平均为0.35 +/- 0.37亚型，并发现了一个新的T8.2候选体。

Conclusion: 该机器学习框架能有效发现和分类晚型超冷矮星，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: The T and Y spectral classes represent the coolest and lowest-mass population
of brown dwarfs, yet their census remains incomplete due to limited statistics.
Existing detection frameworks are often constrained to identifying M, L, and
early T dwarfs, owing to the sparse observational sample of ultracool dwarfs
(UCDs) at later types. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework
capable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on
synthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO
2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of
magnitude larger than any empirical set of >T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations
fitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these
synthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify
and classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant
when validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of
known UCDs with object classification metrics >99% and an average spectral type
precision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5
degree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery
of one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of
this model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from
photometric catalogs.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“不连贯性”的度量方法，用于在没有正确实现（oracle）的情况下量化LLM生成代码的错误概率，实验证明其高效且可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码可能存在语法正确但事实错误的问题，需要一种无需oracle的方法来量化其错误概率。

Method: 提出“不连贯性”度量方法，作为错误概率的下界，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能自动识别约三分之二的错误程序，且无假阳性报告，与oracle评估结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 不连贯性评估可替代oracle评估，为LLM生成的代码提供可靠的错误量化方法。

Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most
successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate:
LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually
incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can
we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence,
that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a
lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program
for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an
extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our
incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of
incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based
evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation.
In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by
the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of
LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural
language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex,
real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory,
planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke
Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic
framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and
achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are
constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with
finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and
context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual
prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse
applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover
from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with
both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for
executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and
demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the
PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent
communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic
benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive
planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and
state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability,
offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex
environments.

Motivation: cAI系统由多种AI模型组成，部署在移动边缘平台上时面临动态工作负载变化的挑战，现有调度策略无法满足需求。

Method: 提出Twill框架，采用任务亲和性感知的集群映射和迁移、优先级感知的任务冻结/解冻以及DVFS技术。

Result: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin NX平台上实现，相比现有技术，平均降低推理延迟54%，同时满足功耗预算。

Conclusion: Twill框架有效解决了cAI系统在移动边缘平台上的调度问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems.
cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs),
transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of
computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services
on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent
DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown
sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or
transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle
concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this
work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous
mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle
concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware
cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and
DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and
deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate
Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary
DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring
power budgets.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of intelligent cities is to create efficient,
livable, and sustainable urban environments using big data and artificial
intelligence technologies. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic
understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent
agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this
article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are
semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used
for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of
urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we
survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,
encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and
learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into
five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and
urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we
discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world
deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey
aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and
to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban
intelligence. A curated list of relevant papers and open-source resources is

Motivation: 解决现代企业处理非结构化报告时效率低、灵活性差的问题。

Method: 采用三层系统（微、中、宏观），标记问题并链接到源页面，生成可搜索的YAML文件。

Result: 在测试中，VTS-AI速度与ChatGPT相当，但提供更丰富的结果（如页面位置、因果链接等）。

Conclusion: VTS-AI有望成为快速商业分析的生产级工具，未来将扩展功能以增强财务分析和数据安全。

Abstract: Modern firms face a flood of dense, unstructured reports. Turning these
documents into usable insights takes heavy effort and is far from agile when
quick answers are needed. VTS-AI tackles this gap. It integrates Visual
Thinking Strategies, which emphasize evidence-based observation, linking, and
thinking, into AI agents, so the agents can extract business insights from
unstructured text, tables, and images at scale. The system works in three tiers
(micro, meso, macro). It tags issues, links them to source pages, and rolls
them into clear action levers stored in a searchable YAML file. In tests on an
18-page business report, VTS-AI matched the speed of a one-shot ChatGPT prompt
yet produced richer findings: page locations, verbatim excerpts, severity
scores, and causal links. Analysts can accept or adjust these outputs in the
same IDE, keeping human judgment in the loop. Early results show VTS-AI spots
the direction of key metrics and flags where deeper number-crunching is needed.
Next steps include mapping narrative tags to financial ratios, adding
finance-tuned language models through a Model-Context Protocol, and building a
Risk & Safety Layer to stress-test models and secure data. These upgrades aim
to make VTS-AI a production-ready, audit-friendly tool for rapid business
analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合AST嵌入和RAG的新方法，用于提升SVRF代码合成的准确性和效率，在740条DRC规则测试中实现了40%的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着半导体节点的发展，传统SVRF开发方法因复杂设计规则而失效，亟需新方法填补技术空白。

Method: 采用AST嵌入进行结构验证，结合RAG注入领域知识，优化代码生成流程。

Result: 在740条DRC规则测试中，代码生成准确率提升40%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了SVRF开发效率，还减少了人工纠错，显著提高了生产力。

Abstract: Standard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) is essential for semiconductor
applications like Design Rule Check (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS), and
Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and it faces challenges as advancing nodes
create complex design rules that renders traditional SVRF development
ineffective and highlight an expertise gap. This paper introduces a novel
methodology integrating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced SVRF code synthesis, ensuring
semantic accuracy and error minimization through structural validation with
domain-specific insights for precise code generation.
  We evaluate different T5-based models and propose an innovative SVRF-specific
scoring framework that complements standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L. In
our approach, AST provides rigorous structural validation, while RAG infuses
relevant domain knowledge, effectively enhancing the code generation workflow.
  Testing on a comprehensive benchmark of 740 DRC rule implementations, our
methodology demonstrates up to a 40\% improvement in code generation accuracy
compared to basic text-based fine-tuning process. This fusion of industry
expertise with advanced coding strategies not only optimizes SVRF development
under limited dataset constraints but also creates a more intuitive and
efficient coding environment. Consequently, users can rapidly iterate through
design cycles, reduce manual error correction, and significantly improve
overall productivity.

Motivation: 传统协议一致性测试方法需要人工创建大量测试用例和脚本，效率低下且耗时。LLMs的文本理解和代码生成能力为自动化测试提供了新机会。

Method: iPanda通过关键词方法生成测试用例，采用基于代码的检索增强生成技术生成可执行测试代码，并结合迭代自校正机制优化代码质量。

Result: 实验表明，iPanda在测试代码生成的成功率（Pass@1）上比纯LLM方法提高了4.675到10.751倍。

Conclusion: iPanda框架通过结合LLMs和自动化技术，显著提升了协议一致性测试的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Conformance testing is essential for ensuring that protocol implementations
comply with their specifications. However, traditional testing approaches
involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process
labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities,
providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose
iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol
conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its
implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically
generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based
retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the
implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code
quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine
generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the
generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between
implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on
various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based
approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by
factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.

Abstract: [Context] AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are transforming
software engineering. While several studies highlight productivity
improvements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation.
[Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants
affects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can
evolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled
experiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional
developers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web
application, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled
trial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance.
[Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in
subsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither
difference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was
statistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1. For Phase
1, we also observed a significant effect that corroborates previous
productivity findings: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median decrease in
task completion time. Moreover, for habitual AI users, the mean speedup was
55.9%. [Conclusions] Our study adds to the growing evidence that AI assistants
can effectively accelerate development. Moreover, we did not observe warning
signs of degraded code-level maintainability. We recommend that future research
focus on risks such as code bloat from excessive code generation and the
build-up of cognitive debt as developers invest less mental effort during
implementation.

### [241] [Moment Sampling in Video LLMs for Long-Form Video QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00033)
*Mustafa Chasmai,Gauri Jagatap,Gouthaman KV,Grant Van Horn,Subhransu Maji,Andrea Fanelli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“moment sampling”的新方法，通过文本到视频时刻检索模型指导帧采样，提升长视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在长视频推理中表现不佳，传统帧采样方法易丢失关键帧或引入冗余信息。

Method: 使用轻量级时刻检索模型优先选择与问题最相关的帧，提出“moment sampling”方法。

Result: 在四个长视频问答数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了性能。

Conclusion: “moment sampling”是一种模型无关的方法，显著提升了长视频问答的准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have
significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While
existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with
long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video
content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly
used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of
crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar
frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions
accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video
segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we
investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model
to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel,
model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant
frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a
lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing
on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances
long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on
four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: ER-EMU算法通过自适应经验回放和领域距离度量选择历史数据，解决交通监控中云边协作目标检测的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态交通环境中，模型在适应新数据分布时会遗忘旧知识，现有方法无法有效利用历史数据。

Method: 提出ER-EMU算法，结合FIFO经验缓冲区和DDM-ES算法，利用MK-MMD度量领域差异，选择最不相似的历史数据。

Result: 在Bellevue交通视频数据集上，ER-EMU显著提升了多种云边协作目标检测框架的性能。

Conclusion: ER-EMU通过优化历史数据选择和多样性训练，有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型适应性。

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection
for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose
previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is
especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by
periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains
valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer
some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical
data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply
storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating
all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying
relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model
update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these
limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based
Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel
maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target
domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar
to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates
the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also
preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated
using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation
of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,
involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently
improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative
object detection frameworks.

*Mehmet Yigit Avci,Pedro Borges,Paul Wright,Mehmet Yigitsoy,Sebastien Ourselin,Jorge Cardoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR-CLIP是一种多模态对比学习框架，通过将MRI图像与DICOM元数据对齐，学习对比感知表示，无需依赖人工标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描的准确解释依赖于图像对比度的精确理解，但现有标签（如T1或T2加权）过于粗略，且元数据常不完整或噪声多，影响临床应用。

Method: 提出MR-CLIP框架，通过对比学习将MRI图像与DICOM元数据对齐，学习对比感知表示，训练数据涵盖多种扫描仪和协议。

Result: MR-CLIP能捕捉不同采集间的对比度变化，实现解剖不变表示，在跨模态检索和对比分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: MR-CLIP为临床任务提供了可扩展的解决方案，代码和权重已开源。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical
systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is
primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition
time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast
identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly
used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition
settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,
leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding
to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or
inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks
such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical
workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to
enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving
modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these
challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework
that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware
representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse
clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures
contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling
anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in
cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability
and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are
publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种检测全切片图像（WSI）中伪影的方法，并比较了它们的性能。其中，基于基础模型的方法（FMA）表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI在癌症诊断中广泛应用，但伪影会影响图像分析质量，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出了三种方法：FMA（基于UNI架构）、DLA（基于ResNet50）和KBA（基于手工特征）。

Result: FMA的AUROC最高（0.995），优于DLA（0.977）和KBA（0.940）。

Conclusion: FMA是检测WSI伪影的最有效方法，并开发了质量报告工具以辅助诊断。

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to
digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however,
other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are
also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has
revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis,
it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and
scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address
this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection
approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a
fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning
approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach
(KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based
metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds,
out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood
contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse
scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA
achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]),
outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978])
and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into
actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies
high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂视觉推理任务中的表现，发现其在某些高难度场景（如CaughtCheating）中表现极差，揭示了现有模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有MLLMs在简单任务中表现接近天花板，需要更具挑战性的测试任务来评估其能力，尤其是模拟人类侦探的视觉感知和推理能力。

Method: 通过设计CaughtCheating任务（基于社交媒体中检测伴侣照片可疑线索的场景），对GPT-o3等MLLMs进行实验和分析。

Result: 在CaughtCheating任务中，MLLMs的表现几乎为零，表明其在复杂视觉推理任务中存在显著不足。

Conclusion: CaughtCheating任务为MLLMs提供了高价值的挑战，成功解决此类任务将推动其达到人类侦探水平的感知和推理能力。

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have
achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a
demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel
in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their
potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave
them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But
can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this
question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and
find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we
name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask
others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner.
We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs
lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides
a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value
and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire
human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: VSF-Med是一个端到端的医疗视觉语言模型（VLM）漏洞评分框架，包含文本提示攻击模板、视觉扰动和八维评分标准，用于评估医疗VLM的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗VLM在临床应用中缺乏系统性的安全评估，VSF-Med旨在填补这一空白。

Method: VSF-Med结合了文本攻击模板、视觉扰动和LLM评分标准，通过z-score归一化生成0-32的综合风险指标。

Result: VSF-Med生成了30,000多个对抗样本，结果显示不同VLM在攻击效果、提示注入和安全性绕过方面存在显著差异。

Conclusion: VSF-Med为医疗VLM的安全性评估提供了标准化工具，揭示了现有模型的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining
labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations
in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end
vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel
components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates
targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations
calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical
realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent
judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to
yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available
datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000
adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible
benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated
analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for
persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness,
and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs.
Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase
of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases
of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection
attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中模态分离导致的表示和推理不一致问题。

Method: 引入MANTA框架，通过信息论优化、自适应时间同步、分层内容表示和上下文感知检索，统一视觉和听觉输入到结构化文本空间。

Result: 在长视频问答任务中提升22.6%准确率，30分钟以上视频提升27.3%，时间推理和跨模态理解分别提升23.8%和25.1%。

Conclusion: MANTA为多模态表示的统一提供了新基础，优化了冗余最小化和稀有信号保留。

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches
often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation
and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization
via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual
and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing
with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic
alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2)
adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3)
hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4)
context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize
our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality
for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the
challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves
state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly
significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we
demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement)
and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces
novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while
preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal
representations through structured text.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural
sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to
mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can
severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in
technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring
and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system
designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning
approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two
state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these
models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately
detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery
Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's
performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average
Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05,
89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior
effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection
methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices.
The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant
disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on
manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

in sign language recognition, including data scarcity, high computational
costs, and discrepancies in frame rates between training and inference
environments. By encoding sign language specific parameters, such as handshape,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在多模态任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，影响实际部署的可靠性。现有方法需多次查询，效率低。

Method: 提出ONLY方法，通过文本到视觉熵比选择性放大关键信息，仅需单次查询和单层干预。

Result: ONLY在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，实现高效实时部署。

Conclusion: ONLY为LVLM提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm
for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses.
Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of
multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which
introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable
deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive
decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original
LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However,
these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response
generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that
requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding,
enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual
outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a
text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort
and computational cost. Code is available at https://github.com/zifuwan/ONLY.

Result: 在合成和真实X射线数据集上验证，显示多视图对应关系能显著提升骨折分类性能。

Conclusion: 自监督学习方法可有效提升多视图X射线分析的准确性，为临床诊断提供支持。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing
fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances
have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often
struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an
essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present
a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation
by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between
synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed
radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes.
Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately
predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be
leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture
detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray
datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in
multi-view fracture classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学中的全切片图像（WSIs）因高分辨率和大尺寸难以直接应用深度学习模型，而MIL方法虽有效但性能波动大。

Result: 在2个数据集、3种初始化策略和5种MIL方法上进行了2000多次实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能减少性能波动，简化超参数调优，提高可重复性，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization
of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution
and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying
Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller
patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a
(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution
for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high
variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15
AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL
methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight
initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To
address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL
methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most
stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be
applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also
simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining
computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI
classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies
and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors
to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until
now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the
possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce
MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the
largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered
scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video.
MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking,
and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for
computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be
identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in
both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic
video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations
between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion
patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in
which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In
the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with
amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely
on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do
not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC
provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the
amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth
amodal content. The full dataset is available at

Conclusion: CGEarthEye的卓越表征能力有望推动吉林一号数据在传统地球观测应用中的更广泛和高效应用。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of
intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model
research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various
domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility
and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited
acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have
constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation
models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite
constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level
image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically
designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with
different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the
representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the
first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset
featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single
year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling
strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based
contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.
Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS
tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior
characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter
efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the
exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader
and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.

### [255] [ATSTrack: Enhancing Visual-Language Tracking by Aligning Temporal and Spatial Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00454)
*Yihao Zhen,Qiang Wang,Yu Qiao,Liangqiong Qu,Huijie Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATSTrack是一种新的视觉语言跟踪方法，通过对齐视觉和语言输入的时间和空间尺度差异，提升特征修改效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言跟踪中，目标和语言描述之间的不对齐问题阻碍了跟踪器的性能，尤其是时间和空间尺度的差异未被充分探索。

Method: 将语言描述分解为具有不同属性的短语，并细粒度地修改其特征；引入视觉语言标记以利用前一帧的修改语言信息指导视觉特征提取。

Result: 实验表明，ATSTrack性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: ATSTrack通过时间和空间尺度对齐，有效解决了视觉语言跟踪中的不对齐问题。

Abstract: A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment
between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement.
Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to
preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor
ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the
temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs.
To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances
the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and
\textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as
\textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into
phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial
correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained
manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified
linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract
visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby
reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental
results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to
existing methods. Our code will be released.

*Feiyang Kang,Nadine Chang,Maying Shen,Marc T. Law,Rafid Mahmood,Ruoxi Jia,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaDeDup是一种混合框架，结合密度修剪和模型反馈，自适应地优化数据修剪，显著提升大规模模型训练的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据集的冗余和计算负担挑战机器学习模型训练，现有方法存在任务无关性或计算成本高的问题。

Method: AdaDeDup通过密度修剪和模型反馈自适应调整修剪阈值，分簇优化数据选择。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AdaDeDup显著优于基线方法，减少性能下降，并在修剪20%数据时接近原始模型性能。

Conclusion: AdaDeDup有效提升数据效率，适用于大规模模型训练，代码已开源。

Abstract: The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets
challenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning
offers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing
methods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while
model-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally
prohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid
framework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with
model-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions
data and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy
model to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by
comparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal
adaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more
aggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in
informative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection
benchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster
R-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms
prominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over
54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model
performance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing
data efficiency for large-scale model training. Code is open-sourced.

### [257] [Visual Anagrams Reveal Hidden Differences in Holistic Shape Processing Across Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00493)
*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估方法Configural Shape Score (CSS)，用于衡量视觉模型对全局形状配置的敏感性，发现自监督和语言对齐的Transformer模型表现最佳，并揭示了长程交互的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型主要依赖局部纹理线索，忽视了形状配置的重要性，而人类能同时利用两者。论文旨在评估模型的绝对形状配置能力，而非将形状与纹理对立。

Method: 通过Object-Anagram对测量模型的Configural Shape Score (CSS)，并分析不同模型（卷积、Transformer、混合）的表现，探究其机制。

Result: 自监督和语言对齐的Transformer模型（如DINOv2、SigLIP2、EVA-CLIP）在CSS中表现最佳，依赖长程交互。BagNet表现随机，排除了边界策略。CSS还能预测其他形状相关任务。

Conclusion: 构建鲁棒、通用且类人的视觉系统需同时整合局部纹理和全局形状配置，而非在两者间做人为选择。

Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the
configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest
local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on
shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in
opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that
models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and
obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore
recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence,
operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the
ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local
texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object
categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii)
uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised
and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and
EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes
reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions:
radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive
U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a
mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at
chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that
configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we
propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision
systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture,
but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate
both local-texture and global configural shape.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box-QAymo是一个用于评估和微调视觉语言模型（VLMs）的数据集和基准，专注于用户指定对象的空间和时间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在真实场景中难以捕捉用户意图，现有数据集局限于全场景描述或路径预测，无法评估VLMs对局部用户驱动查询的响应能力。

Method: 提出Box-QAymo数据集，用户通过绘制边界框表达意图，支持层次化评估协议，包括基本能力测试、属性预测、运动理解和时空推理。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在感知问题上表现有限，揭示了与现实世界性能的差距。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更鲁棒和可解释的自动驾驶系统奠定了基础，支持真实条件下的有效用户沟通。

Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous
driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under
idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world
scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene
descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs
can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a
box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs
on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express
intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for
focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess
basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for
box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)
spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To
support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual
attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object
trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality
control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and
difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when
queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving
real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more
robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate
effectively with users under real-world conditions. Project page and dataset

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP图像编码器中注意力头的作用，提出了一种简单有效的注意力消融技术（AAT），通过操纵注意力权重抑制有害头，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP在多种应用中表现稳健，但某些注意力头可能对最终表示产生负面影响，消融这些头可能提升性能。

Method: 提出AAT方法，通过操纵注意力权重抑制特定头的贡献，并针对不同场景设计两种策略。

Result: 实验表明，AAT在跨模态检索等任务中显著提升性能，召回率最高提升11.1%。

Conclusion: AAT能高效优化大规模视觉语言模型，且几乎不增加推理成本。

Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While
CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we
hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final
representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream
tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method,
called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of
specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two
alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT
systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance
representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves
downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up
to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight
the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models
with virtually no increase in inference cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 度假租赁平台中大量未分类的房产图片给旅行者理解空间布局带来挑战，尤其是同类房间较多时。

Method: 结合监督学习的房间类型检测、重叠检测模型及聚类算法，并利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）识别床型。

Result: 模型及整体流程表现优异，显著优于对比学习和预训练嵌入聚类等现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且适用于实时和数据稀缺环境，显著提升了旅行者对房产布局的理解。

Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing
volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization.
This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting
to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple
rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an
effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem,
as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is
valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the
sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient
machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to
perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for
real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised
room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the
overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the
images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally,
the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified
in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's
images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the
aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its
entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms
established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with
pretrained embeddings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MIV-head的新方法，用于解决在无法微调主干网络的情况下进行跨域小样本学习的问题。该方法通过多实例验证任务实现高效分类，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究背景是实际应用中无法微调主干网络的场景日益普遍，需要解决由冻结主干网络产生的低质量静态嵌入问题。

Method: 提出MIV-head方法，将小样本分类视为多实例验证任务，设计了一种与预训练主干网络无关且计算高效的分类头。

Result: 在跨域小样本图像分类任务中，MIV-head性能优于现有适配器方法，且适应成本更低。

Conclusion: MIV-head在无需微调主干网络的情况下实现了高效的小样本域适应，性能优越。

Abstract: We investigate cross-domain few-shot learning under the constraint that
fine-tuning of backbones (i.e., feature extractors) is impossible or infeasible
-- a scenario that is increasingly common in practical use cases. Handling the
low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones
leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of
multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we
introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head",
akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and
computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when
trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong
performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without
fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting
under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for
cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf
convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on
ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when
compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods
applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation
cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind
in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components
of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展导致合成视频真实性极高，现有检测方法难以泛化且难以捕捉时间不一致性。

Method: 基于“感知直线化”假设，使用预训练的DINOv2模型量化视频的神经表示域中的时间曲率和逐步距离，训练分类器。

Result: 在VidProM基准测试中达到97.17%准确率和98.63% AUROC，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReStraV为AI生成视频检测提供了低成本、高效的解决方案，并揭示了神经表示几何学的新应用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic
videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising
urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with
generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose
ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish
natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening"
hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight
in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected
geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer
(DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the
model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for
each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos
exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to
real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection
performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark),
substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is
computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection
solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation
geometry for AI-generated video detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出Bisecle方法，通过多方向监督模块和对比提示学习方案解决视频语言持续学习中的遗忘和更新冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频数据流不断变化，现有视觉语言模型在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘和更新冲突的挑战。

Method: 受海马体快速绑定和模式分离机制启发，提出多方向监督模块和对比提示学习方案。

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中，Bisecle有效减轻遗忘并提升跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Bisecle方法为视频语言持续学习提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in
video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as
continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable
glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data
distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational
costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters
is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new
challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large
multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update
conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient
continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly
efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the
rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this
work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a
multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal
relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate
task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and
separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex
experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video
understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle,
demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task
generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.

TL;DR: TopoStreamer提出了一种端到端的时间感知模型，用于车道段拓扑推理，解决了现有方法在位置嵌入和属性学习上的不足，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在车道段拓扑推理中存在位置嵌入不一致和时序多属性学习的局限性，影响了道路网络的准确重建。

Method: TopoStreamer引入了流式属性约束、动态车道边界位置编码和车道段去噪三项关键技术。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上，TopoStreamer在车道段感知和中心线感知任务中分别实现了+3.4% mAP和+2.1% OLS的性能提升。

Conclusion: TopoStreamer通过改进时序一致性和位置信息学习，显著提升了车道段拓扑推理的准确性。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by
capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their
semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform
road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the
limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute
learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address
these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model
for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces
three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute
constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary
coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information
within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment
patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the
accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which
serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving.
On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4%
mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

Motivation: 现有防御方法针对从头训练的模型设计，对微调模型效果不佳，甚至引入额外风险，因此需要一种更有效的保护个性化模型的方法。

Method: 方法分为三阶段：1) 创建保留共同特征但破坏数据集特定特征的影子模型；2) 训练元分类器识别可疑模型是否包含受害模型的特定特征；3) 通过假设检验验证所有权。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验验证了该方法能同时检测多种模型窃取类型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化模型提供了一种安全、鲁棒的所有权验证解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream
tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with
private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable
intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs,
model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized
models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods
(developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from
scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment,
or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for
personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our
method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow
models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting
dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the
victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models.
After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by
determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of
the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by
hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.

Conclusion: 该方法为统一图像修复提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level
vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks,
limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on
training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints.
To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach
through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion
model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide
sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition.
Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with
the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent
refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and
robustness. Our code and data will be available at

Motivation: 探索V-MLLMs在对抗攻击中的脆弱性，解决其跨模态推理机制、时间依赖性和计算限制的独特挑战。

Method: 提出CAVALRY-V框架，包括双目标损失函数和两阶段生成器，结合大规模预训练和微调。

Result: 在视频理解基准测试中，CAVALRY-V优于现有攻击方法，平均提升22.8%，并在图像理解任务中实现34.4%的平均增益。

Conclusion: CAVALRY-V为多模态系统的对抗研究提供了基础性方法，展示了其在跨模态攻击中的潜力。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique
challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies,
and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal
Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that
directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language
generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the
model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine
cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage
generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model
transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence.
Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks
demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods,
achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both
commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5,
InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves

*Peter Pavlík,Marc Schleiss,Anna Bou Ezzeddine,Viera Rozinajová*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在降水临近预报中使用Echo Top Height（ETH）作为辅助输入变量，发现ETH在低雨强阈值下能提升预报能力，但在高雨强下效果不一致且会低估降水强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报对天气敏感行业至关重要，现有深度学习模型多依赖2D雷达反射率，忽略了3D雷达数据中的垂直信息。

Method: 使用ETH作为辅助输入变量，通过单通道3D U-Net处理雷达反射率和ETH数据。

Result: ETH在低雨强下提升预报能力，但在高雨强下效果不佳且会低估降水强度。

Conclusion: 研究为评估额外变量对临近预报性能的潜在贡献奠定了基础。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting -- the short-term prediction of rainfall using
recent radar observations -- is critical for weather-sensitive sectors such as
transportation, agriculture, and disaster mitigation. While recent deep
learning models have shown promise in improving nowcasting skill, most
approaches rely solely on 2D radar reflectivity fields, discarding valuable
vertical information available in the full 3D radar volume. In this work, we
explore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the
maximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary
input variable for deep learning-based nowcasting. We examine the relationship
between ETH and radar reflectivity, confirming its relevance for predicting
rainfall intensity. We implement a single-pass 3D U-Net that processes both the
radar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels. While our models are
able to leverage ETH to improve skill at low rain-rate thresholds, results are
inconsistent at higher intensities and the models with ETH systematically
underestimate precipitation intensity. Three case studies are used to
illustrate how ETH can help in some cases, but also confuse the models and
increase the error variance. Nonetheless, the study serves as a foundation for
critically assessing the potential contribution of additional variables to
nowcasting performance.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to
advance general-purpose multimodal reasoning. In this report, we share our key
findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We
first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential
through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the
final performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then
unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability
enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving,
video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents,
and long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this
field, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art
performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation
across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all
tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks
relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably,
GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance
compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including
long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong
capabilities. Code, models and more information are released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用术前MRI数据和术中单张图像训练NeRF的方法，解决了手术场景中多视角数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在3D重建和视图合成中表现出色，但在手术场景中，由于时间限制无法获取多视角数据，限制了其应用。本文旨在通过结合术前数据和术中单张图像，实现高效的NeRF训练。

Method: 利用术前MRI数据构建训练集，通过神经风格迁移（结合WTC2和STROTSS）将术中图像的外观转移到训练集，实现单张图像的快速NeRF训练。

Result: 在四个神经外科案例中验证，与真实手术显微镜图像训练的NeRF模型相比，显示出高重建保真度和风格一致性，结构相似性接近真实数据。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在手术场景中单张图像训练NeRF的可行性，克服了传统多视角方法的限制。

Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D
reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view
data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only
limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data
intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses
this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative
data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera
viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.
Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the
pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically
combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables
the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.
Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope
images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics
indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared
with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,
confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF
training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional
multi-view methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注工具表示优化，忽视了精确查询理解的重要性，MassTool旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用双塔架构（工具使用检测塔和工具检索塔），结合QC-GCN和SUIM模块，并通过AdaKT实现多任务学习。

Result: 实验证明MassTool显著提升了检索准确性。

Conclusion: MassTool通过双步顺序决策管道实现了精确的查询理解，为工具检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tool retrieval is a critical component in enabling large language models
(LLMs) to interact effectively with external tools. It aims to precisely filter
the massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream
tool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on
optimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise
query comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task
search-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool
retrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage
detection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval
tower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for
effective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent
modeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an
adaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning.
By jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and
contrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step
sequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool.

Result: 建议将群体推荐系统设计为AI代理辅助的聊天环境，以更自然地支持群体决策。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究领域重新定位，利用现代AI技术提升群体推荐系统的实用性和普及度。

Abstract: More than twenty-five years ago, first ideas were developed on how to design
a system that can provide recommendations to groups of users instead of
individual users. Since then, a rich variety of algorithmic proposals were
published, e.g., on how to acquire individual preferences, how to aggregate
them, and how to generate recommendations for groups of users. However, despite
the rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group
recommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in
academic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group
and how recommendation-supported decisions are made. In this essay, we argue
that these common assumptions and corresponding system designs often may not
match the needs or expectations of users. We thus call for a reorientation in
this research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI
assistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we
envision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members
interact in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the
decision-making process in an agentic way. Ultimately, this shall lead to a
more natural group decision-making environment and finally to wider adoption of
group recommendation systems in practice.

Conclusion: WebArXiv为评估网页代理提供了可靠基准，动态反射机制显著提升了代理性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development
of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real
websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the
instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on
dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce
WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks
grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable
evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground
truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we
identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents
over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a
lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively
retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten
state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance
differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed
reflection strategy.

Abstract: Approximating complex probability distributions, such as Bayesian posterior
distributions, is of central interest in many applications. We study the
expressivity of geometric Gaussian approximations. These consist of
approximations by Gaussian pushforwards through diffeomorphisms or Riemannian
exponential maps. We first review these two different kinds of geometric
Gaussian approximations. Then we explore their relationship to one another. We
further provide a constructive proof that such geometric Gaussian
approximations are universal, in that they can capture any probability
distribution. Finally, we discuss whether, given a family of probability
distributions, a common diffeomorphism can be found to obtain uniformly
high-quality geometric Gaussian approximations for that family.
